I love this brand and all the flavors available.  For me it is not just Better but perfect.  I never waste a can of broth anymore-- make exactly what I need.  For me, it tastes much better, and depending upon what I am making, I can make it as strong or as weak as I want. I introduced my adult children to it -- they love it too. Mushroom gravy on that steak anyone?  Yum Yum.	1

Our family loves to use this cheese to make cheese-flavored popcorn. We do a light coat of the popcorn with butter (so the powder sticks) then toss it around in a couple of tablespoons of this stuff, and it's awesome. Flavor is just perfect. We also sometimes use it to turn cream sauces into cheese sauces.	1
Last month my husband and I went there during Restaurant week and we ordered the calamari as our appetizer. We both were sick the next day, with all of the above symptoms. (didnt associate it to being the calamari because we ea there often). We had family members in town this past weekend and we took them there. Again, ordered the calamari and everyone is sick with the same symptoms after eating the calamari. My husband called the restaurant this morning and was asked did we order the calamari!!!!!!!!!!!!! Was told we were the 3rd complaint regarding getting sick after eating the calamari . They took down our number to call us back????????	0
