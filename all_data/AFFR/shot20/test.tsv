A little goes a Loooong way.  My last set lasted about 6 years, but then started to dry up a bit, so I selected this set of 8 since it seems to have all the main colors and can be mixed to create any other colors desired. Sometimes the lids tend to leak a bit, just make sure you store them upright!	1
A little worried about ordering food off of Amazon, but they were delicious around the rim of our grinch punch.	1
A must have in your baking collection.  It allows you to create professional looking  bakery quality cakes.  I don't know how I survived without them.	1
A nice assortment of colors that I use in decorating cakes for all occasions. Wilton quality never fails to perform for me.	1
A nice true black with sparkles!  I lightly wet down the black buttons on my snowman cake and rolled in these great sparkles to create a look of coal.  You do need to roll a few times to get the achieved look, but I was working with fondant as to frosting.	1
A really pretty shade of silver and it did not at all make the food taste weird. Also, I've gotten word that Immortan Joe approves of this color. He says it's shiny enough for Valhalla	1
A re-order of these great seasonings	1
A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go...... who always has time for a sit down breakfast? ... Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD !	1
A whole lot of reindeer noses.	1
About to order my fourth box this year. It makes a smooth brew, ideal for my latte	1
Absolute favorite flavor.  Good price here on Amazon too.	1
Absolutely amazing. Did a pearl anniversary cake. After trying the pearl airbrush at work, I went to Michael's and bought this for about $4. Gave a perfect pearl color on buttercream icing. A+++++++	1
Absolutely amazing. I made some jerky with ground beef (hamburger meat) and it tastes like jerky. The second time I tried it was with steak, and it is even better than the jerky you buy in stores, for a better price as well. Instructions for the use of the Jerky Spice are very simple and it makes a great snack for the family! Shipping was fast and the package came in with no problems.	1
Absolutely beautiful!  Giving as a shower gift to my daughter in law to be, and the china figurine is delicate, classic, and fluid in motion with the dancing couple.  Sits solidly on the table top, and the silver tones on the couple are perfectly placed.  Would highly recommend!	1
Absolutely delicious. I use it on pizza all the time. I haven't tried it on pasta but I'm sure it's delicious on that too.	1
Absolutely love Chef Paul's seasonings. These did not disappoint!  Adds such flavor to your dishes.	1
Absolutely love it. Consistently gives the right blend and flavor to my jerky creation.	1
Absolutely love these.	1
Absolutely perfect!!  Hands down best green curry paste EVER!!  haha!!  The nuances in this curry paste are so fresh and authentic tasting.  Thank you Mae Ploy!!  Ordered the Panang version as well but haven't tried that yet!!	1
Absolutely the best & easiest way to make jerky!!	1
Absolutely the best power bar made - in my opinion. It is strictly a matter of taste in these things - but the banana is the only flavor that I actually enjoy eating. Very dry - but meant to be consumed with water - I love it!	1
Absolutely the best. After trying several other cures, I'd never use a different brand again. The taste is the best and its so easy to use	1
Accidentally whiffed this and visions of Valhalla flooded my brain....oh what a LOVELY DAY!!!!!!	1
Add a little class to the top of cakes!  Recommend using by all means.	1
Add a lot of flavor. Worth it	1
Added to a baby shower cake they looked great!	1
Adds great flavor to pizzas and pasta.  Just shake it on.  I have used this for years but now I can't find it local where I live.  Glad I found it on Amazon.	1
Adds great taste to pizza and pasta	1
Adds just the right amount of seasoning to make the flavors pop!  Easy to use and not hot.  Paired with Chef Paul's cookbook, my foods are turning out great and my family is even commenting on how I have shaken things up.  Easy to use and best of all..........NO MSG!!!!	1
Adds Pazazzzzz to give a finishing touch to my icings.  I love the glistening look.	1
After being introduced to this brand of tea I found myself hooked and has been using it religiously.	1
after FAR too long seeking to mimic the cuisine of the local thai restaurateurs(without seeking help online or simply asking) i discovered mae ploy by accident in some hippy dippy food shop. this paste is all that stands between a bizarre amalgamation of food and authentic thai goodness. buy it add some veggies some coconut milk serve with rice on side. you will not regret it.	1
After having used the seasoning salt for years, and running out of my current can, I decided to try the set.  I'm glad I did.  I still use the seasoning salt the most, then the salmon seasoning next, and the others rarely.  Still, they're all good.	1
After we ordered these we got some really hot days..I was expecting a melted clump..we were delighted to receive them packed securely cold and well insulated !...the whoppers are a link to childhood for us..totally awesome. Thanks	1
Agree with most posters that this is really the best. I don't know if the price is right, but considering this might be a 4-6 month supply for me, I'm satisfied. Just don't buy the little jar of Thai Kitchen green curry, whatever you do. I will be throwing it away now that this Mae Ploy has arrived.	1
All have been very tasty. Good product.	1
all items were just what we needed,	1
All my kids love these!	1
All of Chef Paul's seasoning mixes are amazing.  This one is a stable on homemade pizza night in our house.	1
All products from wilton are absolutely incredible. These are not tiny balls of sprinkles, they are slightly bigger and just what I was looking for for the cake idea I had. A must buy for fabulous ideas. Arrived quickly : ) so that was a plus.	1
All the colors are vibrant, brand new and will come out exactly as you want them if you ad the color slowly	1
All the colors you need to color the icing. You don't even need to use a lot. Just a couple of drops. That's it. Feel like a pro baker.	1
All the flavors are great.  Makes good jerky out of plain hamburger!	1
All the flavors were delicious.	1
All the spices are excellent. Seafood Magic is why I ordered this.  It is the best spice I have tasted for grilled fish-giving it a mild cajun flavor. I Will order again!	1
almost everything you need to decorate	1
Already purchased a few, perfect for my baking . I love it . Soo easy to use.	1
Although I do enjoy the occasional cup of coffee, I've never really been an avid coffee-drinker. I had a cup of Douwe Egberts at a local restaurant during a holiday party and had to order some for my office. Everyone in the office agrees that this is a hit. It isn't bitter at all and is delicious black (which coming from me is pretty astonishing- I always add cream and sugar to coffee).	1
Although I have a Keurig and so use coffee pods I  also use my percolator at times especially when on my patio. The Starbucks dark Roast coffee is very good indeed. It is quite a strong blend which is what I enjoy and I hope to buy more when the need arises	1
Although messy, this product gave me fantastic results for my Christmas cookies. It dries pretty quick although the spray smells overpowering when wet. Once the spray was dry on my cookies, I could taste no difference. Make sure you have your work area properly covered, because I held the cookies in my hand inside the sink to spray them. My hand sure did look pretty when I was done!	1
Although the teriyaki seasoning is a wonderful alternative, there is no true winner for great jerky flavor than the Original.	1
ALWAYS A GOOD SNACK TO KEEP YOU ROLLING ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IF YOU CANT GET TO LUNCH	1
Always a great snack	1
Always been a jerky lover and love to cook. My brother got me a jerky canon for my birthday and I've been making a ton of jerky since. The canon isn't weapons grade but gets the job done but the spices have been great! I'm hooked! Taking a vacation in April and already planing my jerky strategy. Big fan	1
Always good for an afternoon snack and satisfies my chocolate craving.  Thanks for carrying this product.  Will keep buying them.	1
always good from nesco	1
Always great. I actually use it to make home made jerky for my dogs. Slim Jim style. They love them. My husband loves them too.	1
Always have a pack with me.	1
Always helps me breathe easier.	1
Always keep these handy.  sugar free	1
Always liked this jerky mix.	1
Always makes great Jerky	1
Always our favorite.	1
Always purchase wilton white icing.  Very good	1
Always the best	1
Always yummy.	1
Am happy served its purpose.. I just wish i could control the pressure of the can though .. It comes out too fast so u need to practise i guess	1
am waiting for this saturday to do cupcake and change the colors of the cupcake on top	1
Amazing base spice!	1
Amazing coffee that keeps me wanting more, I am very picky and not a huge coffee person but I needed a caffeine fix in the morning so I tried this out. I drink it black everyday it is so delicious!!	1
Amazing deal. Never buying from the store again. I split it between work and home.	1
Amazing flavor!	1
Amazing flavors!! You only need a little bit and you get great flavor!	1
Amazing spices - my family loves it - easy to do - and tastes amazing - will soon have to order more	1
Amazing with deer burger!	1
Amazing!  This tea is simply amazing.  Where was this when I was a kid having to go to the doctor for asthma EVERY year?	1
Amazing!! I made a crystal ball cake and sprayed it on for a glassy finish and it worked beautifully! No weird taste that I could detect and sprayed on smoothly.  I want to try some other colors now!	1
Amazon, would you please change this stupid word count requirement to leave reviews? IT'S CREAMER...it was good. I'm a't come up with a paragraph about creamer! I shop Amazon a LOT, but rarely leave a review, because of this requirement. Ok,nonsense now, so I will have enough words: Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada	1
An excellent pre-work out energy source. Gives me the energy I need to push through a vigorous cardio and weight training session. I use it at least three times per week; more if I decide to workout on the weekend. I would definitely recommend to anyone seeking an alternative to traditional pre-work energy sources.	1
An extremely convenient way to carry your choice of flavored coffee creamers requiring no refrigeration!	1
An item that is used by all at our house, good price and quick delivery	1
An old favorite that I was happy to find available on Amazon.  Either I've gotten much bigger or the malt balls and the container have shrunk.  I remember the balls having a larger diameter and the milk container's width and depth, if not height, being greater. The seemingly changed dimensions of the product and the container have not detracted from the treat's enjoyable taste and texture.	1
And this product, the quality and flavor was very good. The package was in good condition, and i will recommend. Thanks you.	1
another great way to enjoy high quality coffee when you're traveling all you need is hot water	1
Apparently every third case consumed contains a secret power stick of gum that if chewed for 30 minutes straight gives you a random ability.  Who knew that excessive sweating was a superpower!	1
Appreciated the prompt delivery. Best jerky seasoning!	1
around Christmas they always run out.  so now I won't run out.  great sugar sprinkles.	1

Arrived quickly and its the bestest!!	1
Arrived quickly, works great!  Did exactly what I expected.  Make sure to also order the seasonings (spice and cure) that make jerky, well, jerky.	1
Arrived within a few days, exactly as described, great price... can't wait to take it on my trip as a portable creamer option!	1
Article high quality manufacturers can be used flexibly for those looking for high quality Fjodtha Do not to request a large quantity is not a history of opportunistic Btoal if you use them very few	1
As a distance runner I've tasted a lot of energy bars and goos and do NOT like them as a rule. But the Vanilla Crisp Power Bar is a pleasant exception - I actually like the taste of this bar and even eat it as a snack when I'm not running. YUM!	1
As a Warboy on a budget, I found this to be a perfect way for me to get to Valhalla all shiny and chrome.  It does burn somewhat when applied, but the glory of being awaited in Valhalla makes it all worth it.	1

As always the Chef doesn't disappoint, this is SO good ! very flavorful.  Would recommend to anyone who would like to try and alternative seasoning that doesn't have all that sodium.	1
As always this product is great! I have been using it every year for several years and we think it is the best!	1
As always top of the line quality.	1
As an amateur baker these have all the colors I need and are extremely vibrant. I even used them mixed with vinegar to color Easter eggs. Great product!	1
As an avid runner I absolutely love these powerbars, taste wonderful, easy packaging and that texture is somewhat heavenly	1
As cake toppers go I didn't care for this one however the bride did, good taste.  It looked great in person	1

As described.  Arrived quickly and pleased with tis product.	1
as described. Easy to bake with.	1
As described. Vibrant colors!	1
As expected. Given as a gift to someone who loves cooking.	1
As mentioned by others, this did not get me into Valhalla.  Still cannot justify a one-star review though.  Despite personal disappointment in the lack of an afterlife, the silver sheen it gave me was amazing.  Witness!  Full stars for effect, would inhale again!	1
As per description	1
As pictured! Love this stuff!	1
As soon as I take a sip or two I can feel a sort of wash and openness in my lungs.  Definitely causes one to breathe easy.  Have a hot tea or add a tea bag or two to your iced tea bags.  Very healthy stuff in there.	1
As the headline says, Yummy and addictive!	1
At first I was surprised it was such a tiny amount, until I realized that a little goes a LONG way.	1
awesome	1
Awesome	1
Awesome addition to any home made or frozen pizza.	1
AWESOME as always! Fun fact... if you're diabetic you can eat all the jerky you want and there's no A1C increase.	1
Awesome candy, but it's nearly impossible for me to stop with one bag, LOL! I'll be buying these again, no doubt much sooner than I should need to.	1
awesome coffee.  great value	1
awesome colors, you need just a very little bit. work great.	1
Awesome flavor, and you can use it for one pound at a time!  Perfect!I started to make my own jerky with the Nesco BJX-5 jerky making kit, and a dehydrator.  I tried using my own seasoning, but it really didn't come out as well as this.  I like the regular jerky flavoring, but this Sweet Hardwood has won me over.  This will be my go-to seasoning in the future.	1
awesome food coloring!  Finally something that makes dark, bold colors!	1
Awesome gum that keeps flavor. Comes in box like the picture shows. 12 packs at $13.68 works out to $1.14 per pack which is much cheaper than at a convenience store.	1
Awesome icing colors.  Very, very potent.  You only need a tiny amount for a ton of color.  This will probably last me 10 years.	1
Awesome jerky spice	1
Awesome product we love the flavor	1
Awesome product!  Best Jerky seasoning I have found yet.  Perfect amount of spice!  Will deffinatly purchase more in the future!	1
Awesome product!!!	1
Awesome seasoning set! Thanks for this great deal!	1
Awesome seasoning!  My family loved it!	1
Awesome seasoning!  Peppery and garlicy	1
Awesome seasoning! Used it on both beef and venison.  Both turned out fantastic.  I added some ground thai pepper powder for nice spicy kick.	1
Awesome set of sprinkles!  We loved them!	1
Awesome small sample of great seasonings!	1
Awesome sparkle! Looked great would recommend.	1
Awesome they did their job.  I eat them before I work out and they keep me from cramping and give me energy	1
awesome white	1
Awesome!  So far I made 2 the original & hot& spicy.  Both doctored up of course!  Everyone loved it!	1
Awesome! it looks so cool on cupcakes, I really love it! Too bad I cannot buy it in Prague :-(	1
Awesome, Just what I wanted. Best seasoning ever.I will recommend this product to everyone who likes jerky.Just don't use the Nesco FD-37A American Harvest Food Dehydrator as mine set on fire!	1
Awesome.  Very filling, stick-to-your-ribs.  A mild nutty taste, love it.  The directions make a large 3-cup serving.  4 people could easily share. The muffin recipe on the back is easy and yummy.	1
Bake eternal, shiny and chrome!!!	1
Be careful if you are used to using the packets intended for 1 lb meat. These are for 2 lbs. almost had a disaster.	1
Beautiful aroma, and when brewed in a french press, the coffee is not bitter. Very smooth and rich.	1
Beautiful color	1
Beautiful color. Perfect on our pumpkin cookies	1
Beautiful colors	1
Beautiful colors. Product came just as shown. Less mess than liquid food dye. I'm excited to try out some different color combinations.	1
beautiful easy to use for large quantities of treats	1
Beautiful peice very satisfied . I bought this for my sister as a gift and she loves it. I will be buying again in the future.	1
Beautiful piece of china. Used this as my cake topper at my wedding. Definitely worth the price since it is something you can cherish in a display case after the event as well.	1
Beautiful, vibrant colors, and they shake out nicely from the container.	1
Beautiful. Perfect condition. Classic and sophisticated. Will look amazing on our cake. Timeless enough to pass down to our children.	1
beautifull . small size but color is saturated	1
Because of Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste, green thai curry has become my signature dish. I am always being asked to make it. Remember that it is very spicy so a little goes a long way. The flavors in this paste are complex and varied and make for a delicious curry. We are living overseas (not in Thailand) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon!	1
Been a fan of the traditional (albeit rubbery chewy) Power Bar since the 1980's. Just regret the wrong assumption mail ordering would be cheaper that buying in the store. I would have saved money picking up a box (regularly on sale) at Safeway.	1

Been drinking this coffee for over 10 years. Would not drink any other coffee.	1
Been eating malted milk balls since my parents dropped off the kids at the movie theater on Saturday morning and tickets cosr $0.35.	1
Been having fun with this assortment.  I had worried they would all be over spicy or hot - not the case at all.  Nice assortment and nice spice mix.  Love the poultry one especially and have been adding it to my chicken soup stock.	1
Been looking for this seasoning for a while. It's great on pizza!	1
Been using this seasoning for a few years now. It's amazing I won't change.	1
Been using this several times, I love the flavors! I really like the spicy one and the regular. So simple to use and I get complements on the taste every time!	1
Been using this stuff for probably 10 years, it doesn't get any better!!	1
Before they run Out during Comic-Con.	1
Being newbie to THai cooking, these are great addition to my kitchen. Its tastes really good for vegetable and chicken curry.	1
Belongs in my yummy field.	1
BEST all-purpose seasoning mixes on the market BY FAR!!!  We've used them for years.  All natural, NO MSG, no preservatives and gluten free.  They stay fresh for a long time.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!	1
Best beef jerky seasoning I've ever had	1
best bought jerky seasoning there is.	1
Best brand there is! This is fantastic!	1
Best buy and price for powerbars. Flavor is just like an oatmeal cookie. Great pre-workout snack with some water. Good for runners and high enurance athletes. High in carbs and a good amount of protein.	1
Best cinnamon gum bar none!!	1
Best cinnamon gum ever, and it is hard to find in the store.	1
Best Coffee Around	1
Best coffee ever according to my brother.  Got as a Christmas gift.  Plan to get this Christmas too.	1
Best coffee ever. Was at a wedding and my whole table separately asked the waiter what kind of coffee it was because it was so great. Douwe Egberts it was. Was recently in Aruba, which is a Dutch Colony, and they had it. Waitress scolded me though. It's pronounced  like doe a echberts.	1
Best coffee I have found for my home coffee pot!	1
Best coffee in the world	1

Best coffee we have ever brewed.  Delicious flavor and aroma.	1
best coffee!	1
Best cough drops ever	1
Best cough drops ever and so hard to find in stores. Sugar free is key. No coughing with these. They don't taste great but they handle business	1
Best curry paste around and priced very reasonably. Lasts about 6 months in the fridge!	1
Best curry paste I have ever used. Saves me a ton of time when I need to make a quick curry. I add a little more than called for in the directions. Also, make sure to saute the paste before adding the coconut milk, and make sure to allow enough simmer time for the coconut milk to separate. Following both of these steps closely lets you develop more depth in flavor in a very short amount of time.	1
Best deal around.	1
Best deal out there	1
Best espresso I've had!	1
Best ever	1
Best flavor out there...peanut butter and jelly...yum!!!	1

best jerky spice	1
Best jerky spice around	1
Best jerky spice out there.  Super easy to use. 1 packet of spice, 1 packet of cure, and 1 lb. of ground beef.  Done.  Not too spicy but you can add some red pepper flakes if you want to take it up another level.	1
Best marinade on the market. Tried a few different brands. Love Nesco.  Makes sense since their dehydrator rocks as well.	1
Best mix I have ever used .Consistent in your outcome with those who taste it are all pleased with how it tastes.  This is for hamburger preparation not solid meats. Great products.	1
Best mix I've used.  I use the regular seasoning and add jalapeo and cheese using the jerky gun and casings.  I also like to take and mix the sweet hardwood and hot n spicy together (2lbs of meat) and extrude it out directly onto my dehydrator.  It's a crowd pleaser.  Just the right amount of sweet and spicy.	1
Best of the Douse Egberts	1
Best on the market!	1
Best on the market.  Use it every year with deer.	1
best out there,,,delicious	1
Best price around ... subscribe and save!	1
Best price I could find.  Good quality that has lasted through MANY uses and washes.  Makes it easy and reduces time to get the jerky in the dryer.  Came with a few attachements that give you options in how you dry the meat.	1
Best price I've found.	1

BEST way in the world to add color without that awful, over-powering taste of lots of food coloring.	1
Best!	1
Best. Coffee. Ever.My wife and I are coffee-aholics and really enjoy Douwe Egberts the best of all. The aroma rood is so nice and smooth and really has a genuine taste that you just can't replicate.It might be a little more expensive than brands you can buy locally but it is worth every cent. It has such a distinct and smooth finish that we have never been disappointed. Do yourself a favor and give this coffee a shot and you'll never look back!	1
Best. Gum. Ever! ~N	1
BEST. GUM. EVER!I LOVE LOVE LOVE the taste of this gum, especially right after my first cup of coffee at work.  I feel like it cleans my breath and I hope it cleans up some of the coffee stains (not sure it does but I HOPE).  I always have a case of this stored in my desk drawer.  One in my lunch bag, one in my purse and one in my car.  I never go ANYWHERE without it.	1
Best. Gum. Ever.	1
Better than any allopathic products for colds and allergies.	1
Better than any coffee italiasns make. Bag changed but same beans iinside.smooth and smells amazing	1
Better than expected.	1
Better than store bought jerk	1
Big Whopper house here.  Love these things.  Fantastic value.	1
Bought for bicycling after I realized the cause of my exhaustion was running out of fuel.  For me, eating one quarter bar ever half hour solved the problem.  Taste is good.  Just moist / chewy enough for easy consumption while on my bike.  I did get multiple flavors to break the monotony, not that it is an issue with me.  I also found it re-energizes me while mowing my large, very hilly lawn, which normally takes 3-hours.  I though it was dehydration, but again, was simply running out of fuel.	1
Bought for my father and he loves it. Will buy again	1
Bought for my husband, he said that it was great when he did jerky.  Will be ordering more flavors.	1
Bought it to use for our coffee club at work. Works better than real milk or cream for storage purposes.	1
Bought these in bulk for my girlfriend. Tired of spending more $ at target for them :)	1
Bought this and I have tried every color so far! I'm learning to mix and stuff! Just need a small amount it colors very very well! If I run out! I will purchase more!	1
Bought this as part of a surprise Amaxon box for our grands in Charlotte. They loved Orbit!	1
Bought this for a Christmas present and the recipient was very happy with the product	1
Bought this for husband during Christmas time. Variety packs are great and very tastey. He loves to use them, will have to be ordering more soon.	1
Bought this for my hunter-boyfriend. We broke up shortly after. I think he got all he needed from me. I bought an extra set and now I'm pretty content, too.	1
Bought this for my husband to use.  The kind we had used for years is no longer available anywhere so we decided to give this one a try.  It is VERY good!!  He has had several compliments on the jerky he has made with it and he said we would be ordering it again.	1
Bought this for my mum and these were her comments Very easy to use. The plastic is firm so there is no trouble imprinting on the cake. Would definitely recommend	1
Bought this online as we cannot get it in the store. Make jerky every year with our deer meat and this is the perfect mix. Great price for the amount.	1
BOUGHT THIS PIECE FOR A BRIDAL SHOWER GIFT.  ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY, AND PACKED VERY WELL.  THE ORGINAL BOX AND FORMS ALL INCLUDED.  GREAT PRICE.  BRIDE-TO-BE, HAD THIS LENOX CAKE TOPPER ON HER BRIDAL REGISITRY AT BED,BATH,& B....,IT WAS MORE MONEY AND THEY WERE ALSO CHARGING ME EXTRA FOR SHIPPING.	1
Bought this seasoning after reading some of the reviews. My husband has been wanting to try making his own jerky. Product arrived very quickly and my husband was thrilled.  Product was easy to use and taste was excellent.	1
Bought this spice first in the local food store. Then I ran out and could not find it anywhere. So decided to look online. This Spice is Amazing. You must try it. It is hot but not too hot, so be careful not to put on too much. Unless you like it hot. It has the right flavors to go along with any pizza, but you can still taste the pizza and not just Magic Seasoning blends- pizza pasta magic herbal.	1
Bought this to make green curry chicken. Was significantly easier than I had originally thought thanks to this green curry paste.One thing I didn't expect was for it to actually be in a vacuum sealed back inside of this tub. Was a bit hard to put back in, but I managed it. It also doesn't say on the tub whether it should remain refrigerated after opening or not, so I just put it in the fridge.	1
Bought to make galaxy donuts! They came out awesome.	1
Breathe easy actually works to cut down on my nasal congestions when my alleges act up. The flavor is mostly licorice.	1
bright colors and I like it that it has the 3 colors I need to make King Cake	1
Bubble gum at its finest.	1
Bubblemint is by far the best gum I have chewed in nearly 40 years!!!  Buying on Amazon just makes it cheaper!!!	1
Bubblemint, is my go-to gum! It hydrates, has long lasting flavor and no weird aftertaste. I have to chew gum because my medications leave an awful taste. Plus, it brings out the kid in me sometimes, which is fun! It's become impossible to find it in the stores locally anymore, so it's subscribe time!	1
buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias	1
Bummer. Haven't gotten to Valhalla yet. Also, taste is awful. But perfect anyway. I was shiny and chrome for a triumphant and glorious evening!	1
Buy 2 cans! There isn't alot in this can! I ran out half way through spraying gold oreo balls, I had to come up with something on the fly.	1
Buying gum has gotten so complicated since I was little. Now all the flavors are super charged and minty enoughto burn your tongue... And then came Orbit Strawberry Remix.  This gum smells and tastes yummy and is the best tasting Strawberry gum out.. Enjoy while it lasts.	1
By far my favorite dry seasoning to use. I use it on beef and venison mostly and the jerky is usually gone not long after Im done dehydrating it. I get alot of complements and I have also converted some people who thought they wouldn't like venison or even jerky all together.	1
By far the best tasting energy bar in my humble opinion. I love the chewiness and the chocolaty flavor.	1
By far, the tea that helps with my chronic allergies the best. It's nice to have a cup of tea rather than taking an over the counter allergy medicine.	1
came as described and are a great deal, gum wasn't expired or anything	1
Came as described. Was perfect! It would be pretty difficult to mess up this order.Thanks!! :)	1
came as expected	1
Came in timely manner and fresh.	1
Came quickly and was the deep purple I anticipated. And the best part is was about 1/2 the cost of what was offered in the store.	1
Can was so tiny when it arrived, but a little bit goes a long way!	1
Candy elmo faces for cake/cupcake decorating!my 2 year old grandson loved them.	1
Cannot live without this stuff when mixing icing colors. It's a must have to getting consistent, bold colors across the board.	1
Can't ask for anything else for $8 using subscribe and save, had to load up on this flavor for my fiancee!  Thanks!	1
Can't beat having this amount of gum delivered all together, I don't need to run out and pick up a pack to keep in the car, I just grab it from the house. We don't chew a lot of gum, but it is nice to have around.	1
Can't beat this!!	1
Can't find them locally and they are my favorite for long rides.	1
Can't find this flavor locally, so glad to see PowerBar still makes it! Fast shipping and fresh taste! Will purchase again!	1
Can't get it in the store. favorite cinnamon gum	1
Can't go wrong. Lol	1
Can't make Pizza without this product. Best spice I've used for making Pizza and Calzones.	1
Can't say enough about the cake topper. It will look beautiful on any cake, very detailed & looks expensive without the expensive price.	1
can't see the result since I only use 3 bags. Not sure how it works with breath, but  if you have urinary infection do not use it. it is a little irritated.	1
Can't stop eating them.	1
Can't tell the difference between this and store bought.	1
Captain Walker says that, if used properly, this spray will grant you safe passage to Tomorrow-Morrow Land. Works for me!!!  \m/	1
Carry in my car for when traffic gets intense. I will be witnessed, shiny and chrome.	1
Cheaper than purchasing 3 packs at a brick and mortar store.	1
chewing some now!	1
Chocolate Raspberry Luna Bars are so good, it's hard to believe they're good for you!  Rich and satisfying, sweet and moist, yet made of all healthy ingredients.  Amazon Subscribe and Save is the way to go:  to have enough on hand, and to spend less per bar by purchasing a box or more at a time.	1
Chomp about half of this before a run and you are GTG.  This will provide sustained quick absorbing energy without having to worry about over eating or digesting the wrong foods that will give you a upset stomach.  The good thing too is there is no after taste left in your mouth.  After about 8miles in I usually eat the other half or wait till I am done depending on the type of event I am doing.  I advocate this bars for training, and race day events i.e. running, football, swim etc...	1
Classic. Good quality cookies, delightfully unchanged in the two decades we've ordered either for business meetings or winter tea breaks. Thanks to the big size and dependably tight-fitting lids, we keep earthquake/emergency supplies in these, as well. Incredibly useful if just for the containers. The classic cookies are the icing on the, er, cookie cake.	1
Coffee tastes great!	1
Coffee the way it should be...the only negative is that it appears that you cannot set up a recurring order...	1
Color on this product was beautiful. Just the right shimmery gold I was looking for. Sprays on very nice and evenly and covered very well. A bit on the pricey side, but so worth it to get the look I needed!	1
Colored my white chocolate perfectly. I used it to make cake pops	1
Colorful sprinkles that taste very nice. This is one of those little sprinkle containers that come with several different types of sprinkles.	1
Colorful, tasty sprinkles. This is a good value. Even stood out well on dark chocolate frosting.	1
Colors for my royal icing....oh my	1
Colors without adding excess liquid, no matter how much you add.  Got the really good green and red for Christmas cookies.	1
Colors worked perfectly. Blended well with the chocolates.	1
Consistently delicious-- perfect balance of salt, spice and kick. Powdery spice so it mixes well. Made the mistake of trying another brand, it was awful. The original mix has a bit of kick, which we love, but some might prefer teriyaki. Nesco is our brand of jerky gun, which is how we originally tried this version.	1
Consistently good and spicy. Easy to use and makes great Thai green curry sauce when used with coconut cream or coconut milk and fish sauce. Yummy!	1
Contrary to some other reviews, my six-pack of these arrived just fine, with no more than 1 or 2 broken ones.  Perhaps the packaging has improved?  The dark chocolate ones are hard to find in my area, so this was great.  I plan on ordering again!	1
Convenient packaging and fresh product	1
Couldn't beat the price and convenience for this! I love cinnamon gum, and although it's not Big Red, it's delicious and lasts a lot longer than many mint-type flavors. A must have for the cinnamon lover.	1
Couldn't say a bad word about this product.The taste is phenomenal and saved mea TON of TIME in that I did not have to make it	1
Coworker informed me to try Magic seasoning! I thank him after every meal prepared with this seasoning!	1
Coworkes and guests LOVE this particular seasoning with the ground turkey in the dehydrator. Nesco does a great job of season and curing agent balance. Not to saltyand never lacking flavor.	1
Cuban espresso through Amazon, all the out here in Japan. First time I had espresso was in Miami FL from a Cuban buddy of mine. I ve missed it ever since, I'm thrilled I can taste this wonderful brand again.	1
cup cake fun time for the grand kids	1
Cupcakes, ice cream, cakes, cookies, tea parties...... you name it!!!.My 6 years old daughter love to use this. :D	1
Currently typing this from Valhalla where I was awaited for, shiny and chrome. Recommend to all warboys.	1
Cute colors	1
Cute for kids!	1
Cute little shapes of sprinkles for decorating cupcakes.  Can be purchased at Michaels craft stores as well but decided to add this to my shopping cart for the free shipping and to avoid going out to the stores for xmas shopping.	1
Decided to try this flavor, my whole family enjoyed it. I normally by the original flavor, but I think I'll be buying an equal amount of this from now on.	1
decorated some cupcakes and the kids loved them	1
DEEEEEEEEEEEELISH. Absolutely delicious. I use mine for pre-cut jerky (as opposed to minced meat-formed jerky, like a lot of the Nesco packaging talks about) and it is fantastic. Tons of rave reviews from friends and coworkers. Everyone whom I've given some to LOVES it, including me!	1
Definitely our favorite gum around the house!	1
Delicate wafer with delicious dark chocolate.	1
Delicious addition to the beef jerky process	1
delicious and addictive. What more could you ask for in a gum!	1
Delicious and easy to order from these guys!	1
Delicious and effective!Use these as a snack every time I'm on the trail!	1
Delicious and nutritious	1
Delicious and very fresh.	1
Delicious and what I need on the go! Keeps me full until dinner when I snag it for lunch with a salad.	1
Delicious and worth the price	1
Delicious coffee- wish it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it more often!	1
Delicious coffee!	1
Delicious coffee.  Wonderful aroma.	1
Delicious flavor. We made jerky for us and family. Everyone loved it!	1
Delicious Icing - Great Flavor.  Mix up icing quickly to frost or decorate a cake or cupcakes.	1
Delicious seasoning! Not too salty.	1
Delicious treat.	1
Delicious!  Ordered for the second time.  This is awesome coffee!!	1
Delicious!  The best!	1
delicious!!	1
Delicious!!!  Perfect to serve with ice cream.	1
Delicious, and a bit spicy! I put about three heaping tablespoons in my curry (made with a can of coconut milk & a can of chicken stock, to give you an idea of the volume)- I would say that puts it at a 2 out of 5 on the spiciness scale. This is so much better than the curry paste that you find at the regular grocery store- and much more convenient for me to order rather than driving to the nearest Asian grocery.	1
Delicious, and great to keep in the car if you live in a hot climate, as they will stay nice and soft.Loaded with flavor and fresh pieces. I feel they have improved a TON since their earlier formulas! Way tastier!	1
Delicious.	1
delicious.  good quality.	1
Delicious.  Just what I wanted.  Spicy and flavorful.	1
Delicious.  Makes a ton of curry!	1
Delicious. My favorite energy bar.	1
Delicious. Not too chewy or hard to finish like most protein bars. Tastes great... more like a candy bar than anything. Definitely recommend.	1
Delivered as expected.  Fresh and tasty.	1
delivered as promised	1
Delivered on time, Product as described.	1
did the job!	1
Did the trick for my wife used it to color cookies.	1
Did what I needed it to do	1
Did what it's suppose to do, have used these in different colors - Love it!  Makes cake decorating a synch!  It smells a bit when applying (I think that's from it being aerosol) but it didn't linger long nor did it affect the taste of my home made frosting.  It didn't stain my white tile top counter either.  Just be careful of breathing it in via your nostrils! ...I hade blue (gross I know, lol) boogers for 2 days!	1
didnt use it yet but they're oretty	1
Dis be some proppa equipment for the Warboy. Makes yer teef shiny and chrome, for easy passage to Valhalla, az well az doublin' as a bloody Flametrowa! Top shelf gear for anyone in Joe's army.Seriously though, this s***'s incredibly flammable AND you can spray it on your teeth. What adverse health effects could there be?	1
Discovered this at the Ramada in downtown Fond du Lac, WI - best coffee I'd ever had.  It's hard to find but I knew that Amazon would have it.  The grounds are not quite as smooth as the liquid concentrate that commercial users employ, but still a darn good cup of coffee.  Very smooth and drinkable.	1
do not buy here- they are overcharging- you can get them at lunas website box of 15 for 10 $ less, although i will say htis- this flavor- white chocolate macadamia and nuts ver brownie are the best 2 i have tried. the lemon one they sent in the mail was borrible!	1
Do not, my friends, become addicted to Wilton Silver Color Mist. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence!	1
Does anyone tried it on Oreos ?!	1
Does the job!  I switched from Wilton for making hard candy.  Ateco works better and blends quickly during boiling process (no stirring).  For one batch of hard candy I've found that 2 drops (not 1, not 3) is perfect.	1
Does what's advertised and a great price :)	1
Doesn't get much more affordable than this!  The gum arrived fine, and lasts forever so why not buy it in bulk and save it.  Beats paying 3 times as much in a drugstore.	1
Doing Weight Watchers, I eat a lot of these - they fit the program nicely, make a good breakfast selection and can be packed as a snack for long periods of time.  (I keep a box of them in my earthquake kit, for example.)This is one of my favorite flavors -	1
Don't eat it!It's edible spray paint.It tastes horrible.5 stars!	1
Dont even think of buying anything else....been making jerky for years..but can't match this spice.. I do add a little heat.. Your choice.	1
Don't like synthetic pills?  Neither do I.  I drink a cup of Breathe Easy regularly during allergy season, particularly Cedar season in SW Texas, and it is as good as an antihistamine without the side effects (for us sensitive folk).  Local grocery store couldn't keep in stock, so I got this pack of 6 for cheaper per box than the grocery (and that was not a natural grocer either).  My teens love it too!	1
Doof drums pound as Idive into the lap of death.Valhalla awaits.	1
Douwe Egberts the best!!!	1
Drink this every nite before bed helps with better breathing before bed have this on order every four months love the price.	1
Easiest beef jerky!	1
easy jerky, add more spices to kick it up a notch! Also add liquid smoke, it really adds to the flavor.	1
Easy quick meal after a work out with a decent amount of protein, for all you counters out there. Great taste,  but don't leave in your car or a hot place as it becomes very soft and runny	1
Easy to make recipe, and tastes great!	1
Easy to make, and taste wonderful	1
Easy to measure with the right amount of beef and easy because the cure comes with it in the right amount.  Everyone that has jerky comes back for more when I use this seasoning.  Happy dehydrating.	1
Easy to mix and has a good flavor.	1
Easy to use -  just needed a little practice to control depth of color.  Love the dimension it gave the cake!	1
Easy to use and best flavor I have found.  I use it with ground beef and it tastes fantastic.	1
easy to use and decorated the oreo cookies for our Pirate themed birthday party.	1
Easy to use and delicious flavors!	1
Easy to use and lovely to look at on my cake.	1
Easy to use and tastes great. Lots of flavors.	1
Easy to use at a good price.	1
Easy to use consistent quality..	1
Easy to use, easy to clean, and works like a charm.  I also use it to stuff jalapenos, as I do not cut them in half, but rather hollow them out and stuff from the stem end.	1
Easy to use, great flavor, we bought the original, but have not tried the other spice combinations, but that will be our next purchase.	1
Easy to use, great taste	1
Easy way to make decent tasting jerky.	1
EASY, FLAVORFUL, NO MARINATING TO GET GREAT RESULTS !	1
Economic way to enjoy Orbit bubblemint gum	1
Either you love them or you don't. I guess there's nothing in between. I love them. I love the malty taste in combination with the milk chocolate. One package is considered to be one serving size and just enough to be a perfect treat at no more than 220 calories per package.	1
Enough to make several batches of jerky.	1
Essential when playing DOTA as Wraith King and/or refresher and/or getting the Aegis of the Immortal. I LIVE. I DIE. I LIVE AGAIN!	1
Every color you need. Very good	1
Every flavor is great.	1
Every packet of flavoring is perfect.  We have used beef, turkey, bison and mixes of all.  Would and will be buying more	1
every thing was grate but the shipping out of US not fast.	1
Everyone always loves these.  Nice chocolatey taste and a great item to ship to people living in the South since the hot weather does not melt them into a mess in transit.	1
Everyone in my family loves this PowerBar flavor and buying it by the case, with Prime, is a great deal.	1
Everyone in our family loves this seasoning the best. We have tried the others but always come back to the original Nesco.	1
Everyone love it!	1
Everyone loves these wafers.	1
Everyone loves when I make jerky with this !	1
Everyone who has tasted the venison jerky I've made has loved it with the exception of my 3-year old granddaughter...it was too spicy for her little taste buds 	1
Everyone who tasted it, loved it. Will buy more	1
Everyone's favorite! We have reordered this many times!	1
Everything I eat is gold. This is my favorite thing ever.	1
everything was great,thanks Nessie	1
Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret.	1
Exactly as described	1
Exactly as described - slightly cheaper buying these in bigger bulk than the smaller packs	1
Exactly as described and works great.  I bought this as a gift and I am very happy with and would recommend this to a friend	1
Exactly as described! Sparkly and look great!	1
Exactly what it says...  You get two of the packs you'd find in a grocer check-out lane.  Shipped in a timely fashion and good for your teeth.  Pretty tasty to boot.	1
exactly what it was supposed to be wonderful	1
Exactly what we wanted	1
Exceeded expectations	1

Excellent flavor in curries.  Spicy and wonderful.	1
Excellent for the first time jerky maker.	1
Excellent jerky spice.	1
Excellent marinade for making beef jerky. Just the right taste that is much better than any store bought product.	1
Excellent Organic Peanut Butter! I agree with other reviewers, you should when FIRST OPEN JAR STIR IN CENTER SLOWLY, to let the oil on top seep down and mix properly.  Then you're good to go and enjoy Peanut butter & Jelly soft bread sandwiches. I'm getting the non salt version, though only 80 mg of sodium in this type, unlike alot of commercial brands that have 100 mg or more.	1
Excellent package deal.  This should last us for awhile.  Some of the best seasonings out there.	1
Excellent packaging and I love this gum and so do my grandchildren	1

Excellent source of protein, fills me up, plus too it's delicious !	1
Excellent strong green curry taste! My husband finished his bowl and said I should open a restaurant!  Great product! I will buy again!	1
Excellent value.  I store these in the freezer and make pancakes out of them after mixing with equal parts yogurt and letting it sit in a warm place for 12-24 hours as explained in Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon.	1
Excellent!  Sure, roasting and grinding your own spices is best, but when you are just cooking for yourself or a small party, these spice blends are hard to beat!  I use the the Seafood on sous vide salmon regularly.... I have tried many combos an different personal spices, but it's hard to beat this stuff for an instant winner, I guaranty!  I use the Pork/Veal on a rack of lamb too sous vide.... Happiness every time!!	1
Excellent, as expected	1
Excellent.  Fresh!	1
Except the price...Works very well with my Mr Coffee latte brewer...again, totally subjective...Very stout...I love it!..So glad I found a way around the packet coffee brewers!	1
Expeditious delivery of a uniquely flavorful, (smoothly robust), grind of coffee = I intend to share my positive experience with others.	1
expensive but I love this coffee	1
Extra vibrant colors for cake decorating.	1
Fabulous for Galaxy themed dessert treats! Also helped me enter Valhalla shiny and chrome.	1

Fast shipping was great!	1
Fast Shipping, nice product!	1
Favorite Gum of all time.	1
Favorite gum. Cannot purchase cinnamon in Europe for some reason.	1
Favortie!	1
Fine gum; chews well, nice flavor, excellent nose at first squish, loses a bit of flavor at the finish.  Hints of tire rubber skidding on asphalt adding to the bouquet.  Best not chewed whilst drinking single malt.	1
Finer spray than Pam, and it is odorless and tasteless.	1
Finger paints for candy - great. Wilton name. Seriously, it's what you need for hard candy coloring.	1
first had this coffee in Australia two years ago. Have been buying it since then.  It's my all time favorite.  Great flavor.	1
First time I used gel color.  Very easy to use with vibrant colors.  Follow the instructions using a toothpick to add color.	1
Fits the description perfectly. Great for our office.	1
five stars ...taste great on just about everything. I use it on all my stuff. I hope they never stop selling it	1
Five stars of flavor. Good variety for starters!	1
For anyone wondering, there are nine little Elmos in the package. I cant wait to use them! They are very cute.	1
For my granddaughters - learning how to decorate - #nextgreatbaker!	1
For my son's 2 year birthday party I ordered this and dipped cupcakes frosted in white frosting in these sprinkles to make it look like asphalt.  In the jar the sprinkles look green, but end up looking black once there are enough of them in the frosting.  We then put painted lines with icing and set tiny Car's characters one each side of the road.  They were a hit.	1
For people that enjoy a nice espresso or latte after dinner, these pods are the answer. Easy to make, no mess, great flavor and without the caffeine at nighttime.	1
For people with breathing problems this is an awesome tea and you do feel the difference it makes	1
For those of us with pulmonary conditions [e.g., asthma]  this tea is great!  And, as a tea lover, I have used it successfully  and enjoyed so doing.	1
Found it cheaper here than local glocery store. Great Buy.	1
Found this at a hospital. Taste great.	1
Found this product to perform to the expectations that I desired. I would recommend this to others that they might enjoy.ThanksRay	1
Found this size was a bit too big for 2 people, but we were able to finish them off.	1
Four dollars is a great price for this item. Have not tried it yet but will report back if any problems using it	1
Fresh breath, long lasting flavor, doesn't become rubber hard after 20 minutes of chewing like so many other brands. In fact I can chew on two sticks all day and feel satisfied.	1
Fresh, tasty, arrived earlier than promised	1
Fresh, very fresh gum.	1
Fresh. Great price.	1
Friend's favorite childhood candy. Merry Christmas :)	1
from start to finish everything went well!	1
Gag gift for niece who likes this but finds they run out of it at church. Now she can just pop a couple of them in her` pocket on her way to church! She was thrilled!!!	1
Gave this as a wedding gift and it was really appreciated. It's a beautiful item for weddings or aniversaries. Sent it overseas after I received it, and it arrived in good condition. It was well packaged. Can't lose with Lenox....beautiful figurines always.	1
Get many compliments on the flavor of the jerky I make with this product. I continue to purchase.	1

Good cough drops/sore throat drops	1
Good deal and arrived quickly.	1
Good deal!	1
Good flavor and this is a much cheaper way to buy it than via the supermarket.	1
good flavor but a bit strong. Mat want to use a bit less of the mix or add additional beef. Good product	1
Good flavored spices.. We usually get the original and it's easy to use and once the jerky is done it lasts for months in the refrigerator.	1
Good for menopause too.	1
Good for the price and does not have weird flavour!	1
Good Gum nice price.	1
Good item.  Will buy again.	1

Good product	1
Good product and fast shipping	1
Good product and price	1
Good product and price. Cured/marinated my jerky for 24 hours before dehydrating it. Super flavorful. The ratio was 1 lb of meat per packet but you can easily do 2 lbs of meat for each packet and still get a really good flavor. I would definitely purchase this again!	1
Good product! Just as advertised	1
Good product, easy to use.	1
Good product, works great	1
Good product, Would purchase again.	1
Good product.  Fun colors.  I am having a lot of fun cake decorating and these colors make it very nice.	1
good product. works as described.  used to dye chocolate and fondant with no problems.  only used one time.  will stain your clothes	1
Good quality color come out dark and true.	1
Good quality colors.  Spreads evenly and is not clumpy	1
Good quality flavors this is the go to seasonings for jerky!!!	1
Good quality rock salt. The pieces are appropriate sizes, and they definitely served their purpose well. You can use it for a number of things, including keeping ice at bay, though I recommend crushing it more finely for that. The pieces in the bag we got were about the size of the tip of my thumb.	1
Good quality that produces bright colors.  Consistency is like a gel not liquid.	1
Good seasoning.  I like the hot n spicy and black pepper and garlic the most.  The teriyaki isn't very good in our opinion but overall good seasoning and good price.	1
Good selection of sprinkles and very popular with my kids who eat it like candy, which it is.	1
Good size, little goes a long way!	1
Good source of protein- long lasting and filling	1
Good starter mix . I like to start out with things working right and this does that. Will make my own mixs soon.	1
good stuff and good price	1
Good stuff minus the teriyaki	1
Good stuff!	1
good stuff! But each package doesn't quite marinate 1 lb of meat.  You probably want to double up.Edit:  I take that back....one package will marinate 1 lb.  Make sure you have the right container size and let the meat soak up all the marinade.  You might want to shake it up every once in a while.  Im very happy with the results and all the flavors are fantastic.	1
Good stuff! Combine the marinade with Liquid Smoke and Soy Sauce and you should be money.	1
Good stuff, this gum is.	1
Good stuff.	1
Good stuff.  Healthy, tasty, and best of all...organic, which is the reason I bought it.  I can get multi grain cereal at my local health food store but many times not organic.  Easy to order on line and probably a little less expensive for the larger quantities.  Lately I have been mixing it with a little Kaniwa, which my local Sprouts had on sale, and the combo is also good, and makes it 7 grain instead of 6.	1
Good stuff. Hard to find flavored olive oil in grocery stores. This fits the bill great for salads and cooking.	1
Good stuff. I don't want to say too much... and give away my BBQ secrets. Makes for some awesome ribs though.	1
Good taste and makes good jerky. I like the variety and good instructions	1
good taste as was expected.  I only use the original	1
Good taste, not too sweet and has enough protein per bar. Also tastes much better than the previous protein bars I had.I like it for breakfast.	1
good tasting	1
Good tasting coffee. A little pricey, but it is expected since it is hard to find.	1
Good tea.	1
Good value and good flavors.	1

Gorgeous. Can't wait to use as my cake topper!	1
GORRY ME BLOODBAG! THIS SPRAY IS SO CHROME! BETTER THAN HIGH OCTANE TYPE O!	1
got my order 4 days before my DR said No More Sweets ate them anyway.	1
Got stuck in traffic jam, used it by mistake instead of bad breath spray. Traffic jam was no longer an issue.	1
Got the whole kit, seasoning, jerky press and the dehydrator for my Son's family at Christmas. All 4 of them really like jerky and it gets expensive. now they do a pound at a time, love the taste and enjoy making it. Say it even tastes better than the jerky they were buying.	1
Got these for my first try at Momofuku's birthday cake - Success!  I was really pleased at how colorful they were and how well they were incorporated into the final baked cake.  Will buy again!	1
got this as a gift for my husband.  He likes the variety.  Works great with making deer jerky.	1
Got this for my be great taste and great deal	1
Got this for my daughter, who lives in Istanbul.  She and  her husband love the cinnamon flavor.  Turkey hassugar free gum, but no cinnamon flavor.  There national brand flavor is very strange, an herb like flavor, that isvery unappealing to the American palate.	1
got this for my daughter. she said that she thinks she will really like this since she is just starting out.	1
Got this for my grandson as it is his favorite candy.  Was a little hesitant  on such a large quantity as to how fresh the product would be.The candy was fresh and will be for long enough for my grandson to finish it up.	1
Got this in 2 days, made my first batch, and must say: Dlish! Also, best when using the leanest ground meat you can find.	1
Got this with a coupon and subscribe and save and it was a great price. I love this gum and flavor.	1
Granddaughter (10 years old) likes to bake and enjoys decorating her cupcakes and cookies.  She thinks these are good for both.	1
Granddaughter said this was  so cool	1
Grandson love them	1

Great cereal, easy to make, great texture, baby loves it	1
Great chew for someone addicted to chewing bubble gum. Unfortunately it sticks to dentures, however that does not keep me from chewing it.	1
Great coffee	1

Great Coffee!  Wonderful aroma and a wonderful nutty flavor.	1
Great coffee, but high price. Local stores no longer carry the decafe.	1
Great coffee, even if it happens to be decaf!  Used it for after dinner at a party and everyone loved it!  Great job Starbucks!	1
Great coffee, I brew it in my Bunn coffeemaker.  I think I'll have a cup right now.	1

Great colors. They look very rich and they are so easy to use	1
Great colors. We make lots of icing and make sure we have different kinds of colors just for fun!	1
Great combo.  Works well together.  Tastes great.	1
Great Curry Paste, loved it. Kind of spicy.	1
Great deal and fastThank you	1
Great deal on a very good mix. I use these with 1/4 sliced London Broil which is all but fat free and pound them a little to tenderize and use this mix to make jerky in my Nesco Food Dryer. It turns out great. This is a really good flavored mix. I do however leave some of the salt from the pack out. It works well with 3/4 of the provided salt and the jerky isn't so salty. This is the best price I have found on this mix.	1
Great deal! Thanks.	1
great deal, arrived quickly	1
Great deal; great tasting gum!	1
Great flavor and quality product	1
Great flavor packets for jerky.  Use it as a base spice and add in seperate incredients to complete the affect.	1
Great flavor the best from this brand.	1
Great flavor to this coffee.	1
Great flavor! A little goes a long way but the spice is good!	1
Great flavor! I suggest adding honey to the mix as a variation. I use London Broil.	1
Great flavor, I love this and the garlic and pepper flavor.	1
Great flavor, Love Nesco products for dehydrating.	1
Great flavor, smooth morning coffee.	1
Great flavor,easy to use.	1
Great flavor.	1
Great flavor.  A bit too much sodium though - it's always nice to be able to add your own salt to taste.	1
Great flavor.  I tried this coffee based on the high ratings it received and I was not let down.  I'll be back again to order more. Thanks Douwe voor de geweldige smaak!	1
great flavor.  love the texture; it's like taffy.	1
Great flavor. Easy to use.	1
Great flavor. not carried by most grocery stores anymore.	1
Great flavoring	1
Great flavoring for jerky, trust me	1
Great flavoring. Works great with my jerky gun and dehydrator.	1
great flavors	1
Great flavors. Highly recommend product for jerky lovers out there. I've tried a couple of different flavors and they were all great!	1
Great flavors. Hot N Spicy is my favorite	1
Great flavors. Nice amount of packages. Worth trying. When I don't have the time to mix all of my own spices, these packages are well worth the price.	1
Great flavors. Premeasured to assure consistent recipe balance. Use these in conjunction with nesco dehydration or any other dehydration or oven or smoker. The hot n spicy is hot so beware.	1
Great flavour and a good amount of heat without being too hot. Try it with beef, aubergines, mushrooms and bamboo shoots -- delicious!	1
Great for a healthy breakfast.  I mix a few dried cranberries during cooking and then add sunflower seeds and honey.  Top with plain greek yogurt..	1
Great for breakfast! Easy to cook! And such a great deal compared to getting it at our local Whole Foods.	1
great for cake decorating	1
Great for coloring oils.  Used it to make sensory bottles for my daughter with some mineral oil.  Worked as advertised.  Great colors.  Would definitely purchase in the future.	1
great for cookie icing!	1
Great for cupcakes	1
great for decorating.	1
Great for finishing touch! Not too big but enough to give a nice shine like crystals	1
Great for Halloween!	1
Great for king cakes!	1
Great for making home-made ice cream.	1
Great for pasta and tomato dishes.	1
great for poaching eggs in the micro=wave	1
Great for reenacting all your War Boys' final moments....or coloring cakes, pastries or other food silver.(side note: this stuff is really bitter straight out of the can.)	1
Great for rubs on chicken and pork ribs. It has a lot of heat, which I reduce by adding brown sugar.	1
Great for the office -- product exactly as described -- individual little creamers. Very yummy	1
great for the price, love this	1
Great for the price.	1
great for those of us who cant write straight with frosting (which might I add is a hard thing to do) I just started baking a lot for functions and events (my so just started school LOL) so this comes in handy for bday parties as well as bake sales I really do enjoy that some of the letters are duplicated so that it make writting quicker by putting the words together. awesome little tool :)	1
Great for witnessing me	1
Great game to play by yourself...with no one around...in solitude...where you can interact with the characters...you can slowly become like Muto...you can talk to your computer and swear...it talks back.	1
Great green curry, just like our neighborhood Thai restaurant!	1
Great gum with a flavor that lasts a long while.  I usually prefer mint gums; however, this cinnamon is a great change.  I have bought 3 cases and have not had any problems with it being hard.  Perhaps I don't chew gum for as long as others - I can say that I usually have this gum for about an hour and a half and find that the flavor is still there.  Happy chewing!	1
Great gum, even better value!	1
Great Item As Described Will Buy Again	1
great item, I had no issue with this item at all, I know it is cheaper to purchased in a store like walmarts but I don't drive	1
great jerkey seasoning	1
Great jerky seasoning plenty of flavor	1
Great jerky seasoning!	1
Great Jerky seasoning.	1
Great jerky spices.  With the variety pack, you can't go wrong when you try 'em all to see what you like best.  It also includes the curing powder for turn key jerky: Just mix with meat and dry!  I make double or triple batches and blend different packets to get jerky flavors in between.  Fair price too.  I'll be buying more Nesco.	1
Great Jerky. Easy to use.	1
great little tool	1
great long lasting flavor. My husband and I go through gum like crazy while trying to avoid eating unhealthy foods and avoid eating out of boredom. This gum is great	1
Great mix of seasoning. Affordable and allows you to taste a variety of dishes.	1
Great on chicken wings, steak (surprise) and pork.  Have to try on fish next.  Love this dry rub.  Be sure to purchase the 24oz size or you will be buying again after your first two BBQs.	1
Great Orbit taste. Ordered with a Dash Button.	1
great organic caffeine free tea	1
Great price and great taste	1
great price fast delivery	1
Great price for assorted jimmies!	1
Great price on orbit chewing gum. I don't know why but I found it difficult to find sweet mint in the store now. Also for denture and partial wearers this does not seem to stick to dental work.	1
GREAT PRODUCT  AND PRICE , CUTS BACK ON SNORING	1
Great product & flavor !	1
Great product and arrived very fast! I will be reordering.	1
great product and fast shipping	1
great product and vendor	1
Great product at a fantastic price with lightening fast shipping!!  Great seller!!Thanks!	1
Great product earlier than expected delivery	1
Great product for coloring granulated sugar! Put 1/2 cup regular white granulated sugar in a ziplock baggy then add a few drops color ( using toothpick) reseal the bag getting all the air out first, and squish by hand til color is blended! Saves a lot of money from buying colored sugar!! An easy kid friendly project too!! Great color intensity and no drying time needed!!	1
Great product for the price	1
Great product full flavor and the delivery and packaging is great	1
Great product great price great seller! A+++	1
Great product great price. You can't go wrong.	1
Great product ground venison jerky came out excellent best I have ever made all 4 flavors made snack sticks in dehydrator plus jerky only thing next time I would cut back on cure. 2lb of venison 2 packs of seasoning 1 pack of cure would be about right	1
Great product- I was so used to using Mexican vanilla and this is very close	1
Great product Love the taste and effect.  I use 2-3 per day when I am doing heavy exercise.  It is a great source of energy.	1
great product will use again	1
great product! i just wish it had more  packets inside maybe different flavors other than that its a great product. recommended to get.	1
Great product! I will keep it forever!	1
Great product! I'm using them for the throat, but not for cough. My throat's been dry and scratchy, especially after singing and these little guys have helped! They are a great second choice to the original natural herb drops from Ricola!!	1
Great product! Never waters down my icing!!	1
Great product! Will buy again!	1
Great product! Wish i had ordered the largest bottle you have.	1
Great Product!!!	1
great product, excellent shipping. have used this product for years and I was very satisfied. I like being able to get what I need.	1
Great product, quick shipment.	1
Great product, quite tasty.  If you're going to be eating your beef jerky within a week, you can avoid using all the cure and sub in salt.  Refrigerate it, and should last you at least 2 weeks.	1
Great product, will be back!	1
Great product, worked perfect. Regrettably I did find it at a local craft store for slightly cheaper shortly after.	1
great product.	1
Great product.  As described.	1
Great product.  Have ordered in the past.	1
Great product.  I used this yellow for a Transformer cake and it showed up well.  The can holds a lot of mist.  I have used this three times already and still have more left.  Will be ordering again when needed.	1
Great product.  Just the same as advertised.  Wonderful, vivid colors.I would recommend these to anyone wanting deep, vivid color.	1
Great product.  Only problem I had with it was when I baked with them.  I should've noticed it said Icing Color.  These are definitely made for icings and frostings.  It baked up just fine w/ my cookies but it just browned them a little too fast.	1
Great product.  Wish they carried it in my local area.	1
Great product. Good value. Arrived timely. Very pleased.	1
Great Product. I will use it again and again.	1
Great Product. Just what I expected from Nesco	1

Great quality and value	1
Great robust flavor for those who like their coffee strong.  I am hooked on the taste and look forward to it every day.  Even though it is medium blend and decaf it still has the zing to it that makes it popular with many.I plan to buy more when this is gone.	1
Great rub...... Use it on beer can chicken and wings.	1
Great season for jerky. Taste is unbelievable and the price is great. Love this product n will buy again...	1

Great tasting, didn't have to mix in much dye to get the color I wanted and it all tasted great.  Used it in cream cheese frosting	1
Great tea for ASMATHA!!!!	1
Great tea for sinus issues and easing cold symptoms. Good tasting and needs no sweetening. My kids love it anytime.	1
Great to finally find these spices again ..... Thank you	1
Great to have this box of gum available at home.  Kids love having this around during exam time	1
Great value and compleatly rediculous! Fantastic product.	1
great value for a 24 pack	1
Great value! The gum has a nice flavor and lasts a good amount of time (starts to get hard in over an hour). Only downside is the shape of container can be awkward if it's in a small purse. Overall it's a great deal and gum!	1
Great Value.  A very satisfactory transaction.	1
Great variety and can be trusted. Have used it for years.	1
Great variety and taste.	1
Great variety I can mix and match and surprise kids and get great smiles	1
Great variety of colors, excellent quality as always. Each tub may seem small, but with the amount you have to use for coloring frostings, etc. they will last a long time.	1
Great variety of seasonings and blends. Natural and customized for all types of cooking and salads.	1
Great variety pack of seasoning to try out when making jerky!  I like the original and teriyaki best.  Comes with the salt to cure it too.  Nice set w nice variety from a company that I trust.	1
Great variety pack of seasonings. Enjoyed them all. Hard to find variety pack in stores.	1
Great way to buy gum!	1
great way to get these seasonings. use them a lot	1
Great way to sneak protein into my teenager's diet.	1
Great! Does just what it says.	1
Great! Only place I've been able to find this flavor. Fresh.	1
great. didn't know they had ready to use. Wish I would have research a little more, It was greatly cheaper elsewhere.	1
Greatest herbal tea for colds, allergies, smokers etc. It really does help you breathe easier! Gave to my Uncle who has asthma when he said his chest felt tight & wheezy and he was amazed. I have used for years and hope that they never stop making this product.	1
Greatest seadining	1
Greatest way to prep your baking pans.  Much better than the old oil/grease and flour method	1
Grew up with Douwe Egbert coffee, the best coffee! Happy I can other it in the USA and do not have the ask my sister to send it from The Netherlands	1
Growing up in a typical Puerto Rican family, all we knew was Pilon coffee. Now as an adult with my own family, nothing wakes me up like the aroma of freshly brewed Pilon. Hispanics are all about their coffee and Pilon is definitely one of the best. Try it, you won't be disappointed.	1
Gum addict here. Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm addicted to gum. It has come at a price though, It's an addiction that costs almost $4 for a pack of three at CVS with the wonderfully high tax in Chicago to fund all the political corruption. So this is a blessing and for less than $20 with a subscribe and save,  I can continue funding my addiction while developing stronger jaw.	1
Gum last and gets me through the day.	1
Gum was for my mom she is very Happy with the taste and the price!	1
Had one like this before and used it so much it tore up. So glad I could find another one like it. Great for making jerky!	1
Had the original and it is some of the best jerky mix I have ever used	1
Had this coffee in San Antonio. Love it! Unfortunately I can't find it anywhere in Houston so Amazon it is.	1
Happy with purchase	1
Hard to beat the price. Arrived quickly and exactly as shown.	1
Hard to find for those of us that do not like peanut butter for protein. Great price.	1
Hard to go wrong with this mix.  Original flavor gives great taste for game jerky (antelope, elk, deer).  Just be sure to trim as much fat from your meat as you can prior to grinding.	1
Has a great flavor.  Have used it in several recipes and it works well.	1
Has a very good flavor and aroma.  Makes for a good cup of coffee with or without cream or sugar.	1
have been a user for several years.  starbucks is the best and really not that expensive as I only have a couple cups of joe in the morning.  never thought about the descriptive espresso as I don't use it for that though some could find it misleading. as for me who likes  it bold and like mud its perfect. YUM!!	1
Have been drinking this tea for years.  I used to get Bronchitis all the time and this was what helped me most with the coughing and congestion.  Even now, when I eat something that gives me mucus, this clears it up right away and I am able to sleep.	1
Have been eating this cereal for over three years now. Absolutely love it and it cannot replace any other cereal for me :). Use it with almond milk, honey and nuts...	1
Have made all flavors and am very pleased.  I'm a hit at Bible class !	1
have made several batches and they were great.	1
Have made this jerky in the past.  Very good taste.  I'm in the process of making 5 pounds of jerky at this time.	1
have only used two different seasonings loved both	1
Have ordered this variety pack several times now and love all but the teriyaki flavor.  The man loves all of them!  Would love to see this pack with other varieties included too.	1
Have tried other flavors and other brands but this is my favorite!	1
Have tried several other jerky cures and have to say the by far this is the absolute the best. The taste is fantastic and its so easy to use.	1
Have used many times and still love these for my sugar cookies.  I don't like the crunchy sprinkles and this adds color with out the crunch.	1
have used this for both chicken and beef jerky and every one that has tasted it loves it. .. ..	1
Have used this product for years.  All who sample the jerky want our secret recipe.	1
Have used this seasoning for years and keep coming back.  We usually add both cayenne pepper and jalepeno pepper on top of this seasoning to make our jerky extra spicy (which our friends love!), but for those who want just a good basic jerky flavor, this is really awesome!	1
Haven't quite tried them all yet but these are great spices, yummy.	1
Haven't tried these yet for what I bought them for (long runs), but so far, I love them!  They taste great and not at all sugary when compared to the Jelly Belly Sports Beans.  This is clearly a superior product and not much more expensive.  Pretty sure I'll be buying these again!	1
havent used looks great	1
Having fun with these	1
Having spent some time in Thailand, I found myself missing certain dishes -- in particular, green curry chicken soup.  As there aren't Asian food markets where I live now, I was delighted to find this green curry paste so reasonably priced on Amazon.  I've cooked with it several times now and I've been very pleased with it.	1
hella good	1
Helps distract from the sickness. The shine will draw his gaze, I know it. This time maybe? Witness me.	1
Helps my kids with their asthma.	1
Helps with the asthma.	1
Her is the spice I have pick to make Beef Jerky--I have waited along time  to make beef Jerkyand enjoy the flavor	1
Hi there, These gums are pretty nice, they release the cinnamon flavour but not for a long time. The taste is less strong compare to the classic Big Red but at least they do not contain ASPARTAME. Overall good product sugarfree	1
highly recommend!  Great price and quality of the product.  Would definitely buy again.  Great mix of colors to use for any frosting.	1
Honestly, the Sweet Hardwood flavor is absolutely delicious when used with deer.	1
Hope to be drinking this tea as needed  as it does help to keep my respiratory system clear.	1
how can you not love whopper? yum yum yum	1
How could anything negative be said about old-time buttercream frosting?  This is the first time I've used it, and the results couldn't have been better.  Will certainly order more Wilton products.  Shipped very quickly from seller.	1
How could you not love Orbit Bubble Mint chewing gum? It's refreshing, and will keep your breath nice and fresh!	1
How do you not like whoopers. This was a great gag gift for a friend at Christmas that loves them.	1
Hubby loves it! He said it's got a little kick to it and would like a bit more. He adds hotter stuff to it and just loves it	1
Husband likes this jerky seasoning for his deer jerky.	1
Husband loves this brand and is very happy with this deal.  Cheaper than the hunting stores.	1
Husband loves this for his jerky!	1
Husband loves this stuff.  Uses with ground vension with a jerky gun and dehydrator.  Jerky comes out great and doesn't take a long time to dry.  Everyone he gives it to loves it as well	1
Husband said it was really good stuff	1
I absolutely love the nesco jerky spices. portioned in 6 packets, it's perfect for one pound batches of ground beef jerky. this cracked pepper & garlic is the absolute perfect jerky. if you like black pepper like I do this is great and I add fresh ground pepper on top for more pepper. I wish they sold it in a bigger pack.	1
I actually purchased these to make desserts for a high school graduation party since these are the school colors. Came out nice and I didn't have to buy 2 different shakers of sprinkles!	1
I adore this jerky seasoning. It's salty and savory, everyone I give some jerky to loves it. Only complaint is that it makes me sneeze every time I mix up a batch because the seasoning is so strong and so fine.	1
I agree with the other reviewer... defiantly tastes like samoes, I tried them and didn't even read the reviews and thought I was eating a samoes cookie. don't know what the other reviewer was talking about!	1
I also live in exile in San Francisco, but I'm very loyal to my Miami roots. Pilon Gourmet is the best Cuban coffee, period. And it is extremely hard to get outside of Miami. However, javacabana.com has much better prices.	1
I always have a bottle or two of this on hand.  And good thing too. You never know when you're gonna get attacked on the open road. Happened the other day, but I acted quickly.  I applied my Shiny and Chrome as instructed and burst into action.  Organic!  The rush is intense.  It's like V8 spoke right to my soul.  Witness Me! I screamed as I savaged my foes.  Kamakrazee Warboys!	1
I always use this for my thai risotto. Have not been able to find one that compares so will continue to purchase this one alone.	1
I am a big fan of Chef Paul's and I use these spices often. The fajita spice is better tasting than anything I've ever tried in restaurants. The salmon seasoning is probably my favorite though. Using that while grilling a large piece of salmon with a little butter will make you a legend. Get fancy and and on put some crushed, roasted pecans mixed with a little butter, bake in the oven and you will stun your guests with your own Pecan Encrusted Baked Salmon.	1
I am a long-distance runner and use these as an energy source---they are easier on the stomach than the sports gels and taste great!	1
I am addicted to this Bubblemint gum!	1
I am addicted to this gum. It always tastes fresh. Also, good packaging.	1
I am an hero at the hunting lease.	1
I am CONSTANTLY baking and this icing always gets awesome remarks. Most people are convinced it is homemade! It is light, fluffy and hard not to eat before you get it onto the cake!!	1
I am currently in Valhalla. This spray indeed makes you shiny and chrome.	1
I am happy. ;)	1
I am not a breakfast person, but Luna bars have managed to drag me kicking and screaming into eating something before lunch. Chocolate Peppermint is by far my favorite. I've also found they make great snack bars. And they're a lot cheaper to buy by the box.	1
I am prone to bronchitis which can lead to mild asthma.  This tea has worked better for me for relief than anything else, OTC OR prescription.	1
i am satisfied for my business. It will be great on donuts and cake pops. thank you very much.:)P	1
I am so thankful I had found this at Michels store. I used this on my Jumbo marshellows I had made for my sister in laws baby shower and it was a big hit.  It just made everything look so btful and it was just perfect.  I received so many compliants on the color and so on.  I had order more just to have for later use. So glad it's on Amazon so I don't have to go to the store. I would highly recommend this product.	1
I am super addicted to its malted milk flavored balls. .	1
I am surprise how quickly they arrive , makes for a happy customer	1
I am the scales of justice, conductor of the choir of death!	1
I am very fond of this particular hot cereal (porridge). I usually cook in vanilla almond or soy milk for extra nutrition. Cooked in a double boiler, I can start it and do other things for 20-30 minutes before dishing up a satisfying breakfast for my family. If there is a bit left over, I add it to my pancake or waffle batter the next day. Yum!	1
I am well satisfied with this gum.  I have bought this gum for many years and will continue so in the future!	1
I ate all this already - I have nothing left to review! This is gonna be a short review - I bought this for my Nesco dehydrator.The good part about this review is the spices made the meat taste soo good.  The price is also right for taking premium burger and turning it into premium jerky.The bad part - it takes longer to cook the jerky than to eat it.	1
I baked a cake for my son's third birthday with a buttercream frosting, which, as we all know, often comes out yellow thanks to the butter. I put several drops into my double batch of frosting, and it did noticeably whiten. I will say the my frosting wasn't a perfect white, but I didn't need it to be, and I wanted people to know I'd made it from scratch, so this at the very least brightened the frosting beautifully and did not affect taste or smell.	1
I bought my 11 year old granddaughter the cake pop maker for Christmas and I got these to go with it. She had a great time with set.	1
I bought silver and gold colors to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. This is not a shiny bright gold or silver, it is mat in color. That makes it perfect for my horseshoe cookies.	1
I bought the dryer last year for my sons.  I liked the spice samples it came with but tried others locally.  This kit is by far the best one out there.	1
I bought the sampler kit and the original is the only one that I really enjoyed. It is so good it is hard to describe. I use this for ground beef jerky and 10lbs of jerky is gone in 2 days with this where as with the other flavors it lasts about 3 days.	1
I bought these because of the reviews and hearing that gel was the way to go. I had used grocery store bought gel before and wasn't blown away, but these are different. It doesn't take much at all to color and the colors are accurate. I've used them in cake mixes, frostings and even colored sugar for a project. All came out great!	1
I bought these for making pop cakes, but the product is so versatile for color themes and various holidays to decorate cake batters, cookies and dough or if you are really messy, for making pictures on a slice of toast. LOL.	1
I bought these for my granddaughter who loves to bake.  She was very pleased.	1
I bought these to make a birthday cake for my Father-in-Law and I ended up having to run out to Michael's so that I could buy two more colors to be able to mix and have what I needed. It's a nice set for someone who is just starting out like myself. I would suggest also purchasing white and black just so you're on the safe side if you need to mix colors like I did. I should be all set now!	1
I bought these to make gtas color frosting and turned out perfect with the color leaf grean. Previously used a liquid based color that rewuired a large amount and watered down my frosting. This was the perfect color and consistency.	1
I bought these to use specific colors for a funfetti cake. I needed 2 containers to compleate the recipe and had all the red and orange left over since i didn't want those colors in my cake. They worked well in the end and I was happy with the results. I did mix in a few other sprinkles I had already too, but the majority of them were from here.	1
I bought this after I saw mad max. I wanted to spray it in my mouth and have my brothers witness me ride into Valhalla, shiney and chrome.Tastes kinda weird. It felt a bit like huffing whipped cream.	1
I bought this as a gift for my sister; both she and her husband are really enjoying trying them out.	1
I bought this coffee because my husband drank it and loved it when he lived in Amsterdam.  Now I will not buy any other brand of coffee.  I recommend it to all coffee drinkers.	1
I bought this for crafts and it dyed all kinds of oils perfectly. Occasionally it will settle and you have to shake it back up to remix it but after remixing it, it is back to normal.	1
I bought this for my daughter-in-law to go along with the Wilton set of tips, etc. that I also bought her.	1
I bought this for my driver friend Nux and witnessed his successful journey to Valhalla!  Thank you Wilton for helping my warboy!~Mad M.	1
I bought this for my husband as a supplement to naturally easing breathing issues.  He loves the taste, has one every morning and in just a couple of weeks has noticed a positive change.	1
I bought this for my kids to paint with .You just mix a tiny amount of color with water and the kids have a great time painting. They love to draw using watercolor paint and this is a inexpensive way. And don't have to worry if they paint themselves with it or lick the brush. Lol	1
I bought this once when I was buying stuff to make bagel pizzas.  Since then I have been trying to find more at the store and they stopped selling it.  This is delicious.  I use it on pizza and pasta.  It tastes great. It really helps out when you get a cheap, not so tastey pizza.	1
I bought this original jerky seasoning again for the up coming hunting seasons. The whole family loves this original flavor jerky as I give it out for gifts during the holidays.I'm not very happy this seasoning has doubled in price though, I had to pay twice as much this time as in previous orders.  I recommend this jerky mix, better get it while you still can!	1
I bought this product in order to make a Batman cake for my boyfriends birthday. The black coloring really worked out great and made the icing a rich black color, not grey. I have not used the orange yet but I am sure that it works just as well. The coloring also did not give the icing a bitter flavor either, but it sure made your mouth and anything a touched black as well. Make sure to use a glass or stainless steal bowl as it will leave a plastic one stained.	1
I bought this Thai Green Curry paste to cook a Thai dish I'd seen made on of the cooking shows.  It turned out PERFECT.  I almost make that dish weekly now.  Can't live without my Mae Ploy!	1
I bought this to join my brothers and sisters in Valhalla, but be warned it does sting a little	1
I bought this to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies. Very happy with the result because this is not a shiny or vibrant color. It is mat and it's perfect to recreate a metal look. Will buy again.	1
I bought this to use as white paint to paint on fondant for cakes. It worked perfectly! A little goes a really long way. I don't see running out anytime soon.	1
I bought this to use with sliced beef (rather than the ground jerky version) and so far have only used the terriyaki flavor.  It is very tasty and even better than store bought jerky.  I can't wait to use the other flavors. I will definitely buying again.	1
I breathe so much easier with this tea! It helps me cut my medications in half!	1
I brought a shiny and chrome cake to Valhalla for my brothers who witnessed.	1
I brought this and was not sure after the reviews but baby i love it and my grand-son who doh eat icing after i beg him to try it said Granny high five yuh good did not tell him i brought it lol ah shame now but i love it going and buy me some more thanks Wiltons	1
I buy These ginger chews for when I feel sick to my stomach.  They really help.	1
I buy these spices from Amazon every time I run out. Their absolutely delicious.	1
I buy this all the time an make it for my son; he likes it HOT so I use there base and add 1 Tbl of ceyenne and 2-3 table spoons of ground hot pepper; YELSA!!	1
I BUY! I RETURN! I BUY AGAIN!!	1
I can now decorate a cake nicely by just tracing the designs. The press set is a sturdy plastic, very easy to use!	1
I can't buy this locally, and it's the ideal herbal tea to get rid of the wheezies for me in ten minutes or less.	1
I can't do life without this!	1
I can't even begin to tell you how delicious this is. Spicy and SO good!!! One of my all time favorite tastes that I would eat every day if I could. The only jerky I will eat!!!!	1
I can't find pizza seasoning anywhere. I use it to spice up my lean quisine pizzas, Is very good.  I will probably buy again.	1
I can't live without this everyday!  It totally helps my asthma!  I notice when I don't have a cup or two a day that my asthma is worse. It comforts me and tastes great. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from colds, flu, and any breathing problems.	1
I can't stop eating each dark chocolate wafer stick. It's an addicting snack to eat.	1
I chew a lot of gum... I basically have a piece in my mouth 24/7 to help with my anxiety. Orbit is the only gum that doesn't start falling apart or lose all flavor for 2-3 hours. My gum intake went way down once I switched to Orbit.	1
I could not find this in the stores I love using this cause it does not change the taste of the food	1
I couldn't stand health bars until I tried these bars from Luna.  They are amazing, filling, taste great, low on calories, and contain soy which is great for you!  I am a total chocolate fanatic and these satisfy my cravings without a doubt!  You have to try them!	1
I decided to use these spices for a mixture of venison and beef jerky.  The flavor was exceptionally good and even my son-in law who is very picky liked it.	1
I decorate at least 75-85 dozen Christmas cookies per year for a very happy ,hungry family who waits for them each year. I've always wanted a quicker way to achieve a silver look and this product is perfect!	1
I did get to Valhalla, but I couldn't find Chris Hemsworth anywhere. Highly disappointed. Still rated 5 stars since I did find Valhalla.	1
I did not purchase it for making jerky but it works fine for what I did purchase it for. We use it as a shortening grease gun. We can squirt shortening, in small amounts as needed, and there is no mess. I only wish there was a cap for the end of the nozzle. So far we've only used it once but we love it, as it was the perfect solution to our greasy problem.	1
I didn't buy this product for food but for 'staining' mason jars for my wedding instead. I was amazed at how little coloring was needed to reach the desired shade.	1
I discovered Chef Paul's magic seasoning blends at my job, I love these. They add that special something to your dishes. I ordered this seven pack because buying them separately in the store costs more, plus they don't sell the vegetable blend. You can't go wrong with this set of seasonings, bon appetite	1
I do a lot of baking. When I first got this Bake Easy, my hope was that it would be nearly as good as greasing & flouring a cake pan. To my suprise, it's better. I've used it for cakes, brownies, quick breads of all kinds. It's very good for cakes -- especially ones that are typically reluctant to release from the pan. I've not had a failure yet and it's much quicker and cleaner than the traditional method. (Using veg sprays like PAM are useless for most baking.)	1
I do love this product and that is why I buy online because it can not be purchased locally.  However I have to say this time the seller obviously did not do a very good with their packing because most of the product was broken up into pieces and there was a lot of waste at the bottom.  I will not purchase from them again.	1
I do love this product.  I don't bake a cake without it.	1
I do not like to make some complicated recipe for jerky, so I bought the mix. All you have to do is mix the seasoning & cure with the meat and throw it in the dehydrator. It tastes really good without a bunch of hassle.	1
I do not produce saliva due to an auto immune disease and the sugar free Ricola help with that. I especially like that they're sugar free	1
I do the order for a small grocery store.  When I saw this flavor in the order guide, I ordered it without hesitation.  Luna Bars always sell well, even though I personally am weary of Luna Bars with chocolate in them; the chocolate usually tastes funky, waxy.  Once it arrived, I tried one.  Soooo good!  It's hard to believe that this treat offers health benefits, it's THAT good.  It tastes like a macaroon.  Heaven.  It is now the top selling flavor at the store.	1
I don't always get witnessed into Valhalla, but when I do, I'm using Wilton Silver Color spray. Stay shiny, my friends.	1
I don't always go to Valhalla, but when I do, I use Wilton Silver Color Mist!	1
I don't bake, I bought these for my wife.  She has a lot of Wilton products and is happy with all of them.	1
I don't cook steak without it! It's the best flavor that I have ever found and a must-have in my pantry!	1
I don't know why I love this gum so much but I do. It's long lasting and I don't feel like I'm chewing on toothpaste. Has a nice bubblegum flavor with a hint of mint. I've been using this product for years.	1
I don't know why, but the cinnaman flavor is hard to find at the grocery stores, so it was nice to order this in bulk and have it on hand.	1
I don't only enjoy the flavor but also the price that is offer for. Had ordered more than once.	1
I doubted when I ordered it that it was going to be shiny enough,  but it looks on fondant the way that you would expect spray paint from the hardware store to look on anything else.  Stays shiny even when dry.	1
I drink one of these breathe easy teas each morning, helps with congestion.	1
I drink this every day to support my lung health.	1
I drink this tea at night just before bed. It helps with my respiratory problem. I could breathe. And it helps me sleep as well. Purchasing this item on Amazon was a great idea. Fast delivery. Good price. Great value.	1
I eat gum...a lot.  So I love that I can buy a bunch, save some money, and always have enough.	1
I eat this almost every morning. I cook two minutes in the microwave, followed by two minutes resting time (throw on my walnuts and berries and cinnamon) and then another 30 seconds in the microwave. Yum!	1
I enjoy the blend of spices!!	1
I enjoyed these seasonings.  They are similar to the LEM seasonings, but more affordable. I would purchase again.	1
I especially love the seafood, chicken and pork and veal seasonings. My only wish is that we could build our own sets or buy two or three of the flavors we want. I had to buy the 24 oz of  the veal and pork seasoning - which is not replaceable - in my mind - to have it at all.  It lives in my freezer and I fill an old bottle as needed.	1
I eventually decided to purchase the nestle French vanilla twenty four single serving quantity pack (24 3/8 oz or 11 ml creamers totaling 9 ounces)after seeing it enough times at the cereal section of my job. The French vanilla creamers  have a delectable taste and go perfectly with the swiss miss milk chocolate hot cocoa and the nestle rich milk chocolate cocoas.	1
I find myself using this in much more than intended when I purchased it - tomato soup, rice dishes, in a sauce for vegetables, you name it.  It occasionally gives me shivers, I kid you not.  I keep it in the freezer and after several months it seems to be staying fresh as well as not turning into a solid chunk.	1
I find these cough drops very soothing. Please find a listing of all Inactive Ingredients in attached photo.	1
I first had this in a little town that has no stores, one restaurant open only during salmon fishing season,  a pizza place, and not much more.  Also, no stop lights or stop signs,  you're thru in five minutes.  But the gas station had this coffee in a fresh, hot coffee Idispenser in liquid form.  I couldn't get the liquid form that was only for wholesale so I ordered the brand in  ground coffee from amazon and it is smooth,  strong if you like, and yummy..	1
I first tried this about 15 years ago, and I've stocked it in my spice cabinet ever since! I use this on everything from Eggs to Pasta to Pizza. There's no salt in this stuff, just lots of Herbs, Spices, and Parmesan!Great Stuff! Be Careful though, it can be addictive!	1
I followed the instructions.  It was very tasty but salty.  Next time I will use more meat per packet. Will buy again3/10 made it again.  Added 1/2 cup of srirachi .  Yummy	1
I found I was buying this at the grocery store frequently and decided it would be more cost effective to buy this large package on Amazon.  Wonderful idea!	1
I found it! Shiny and chrome!Oh, what a day! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!	1
i found wilton colors very ssheap  special for me that a love make cakes	1
I gave my parents  this coffee and now it's all they buy	1
i get great reviews on my home made slim jims with this mix!	1
I googled the best way to cook this and a few sites suggest soaking to avoid possible bitterness. After rinsing & soaking for 15 mins I cooked a cup w/ 2/3 water to sample and take for breakfast the next day if I enjoyed the taste. Note I'm a huge cream of wheat fan and I loved the taste and texture of this product. I cooked w/ plain water and this morning at work i put 2 tablespoons of almond milk to help bind while re-heating.. no sugar no extras and it was again enjoyable.	1
I got  this for my sisters wedding and she absolutely loves it.  It is not only a cake topper but a beautiful keepsake when it comes to hold on to after the wedding.	1
I got exactly what I ordered, in a timely fashion, and I love this flavor...good deal.	1
I got one box. Used it up in two days. Just ordered 2 more boxes	1
I got this as a free sample from orbit and pinch me and it's VERY delicious!I definitely recommend it to everyone!	1
I got this for my dad who had a chest cold and they really helped him relax and eased his cough. I often drink them when I am having a hard time inhaling all the way.  They taste good too.	1
I got this product so that I could add the necessary colour to my baked goods. It is wonderful. The gelatinous consistency makes it easy to use sparingly, yet giving you intense, vibrant colours that you can temper out to the most delicate hues and shades.Absolutely wonderful for the novice baker to use.	1
I had a baby birthday cake, and it was delicious in every way!	1
I had a brother! A baby brother! And he was perfect! Perfect in every way!  And becasue he used this product he has been witnessed and accepted to Valhalla where he will ride eternal, shiny and chrome!	1
I had a chance to try the icing a few days ago and I am pleased with it. as prepared on the package it is stiff and the spoon can stand right up in it. It is perfect for icing layer cakes or any pastry. I think you may need some titanium dioxide if you want it as white as the package or use very white cream and butter, good luck	1
I had been searching for this product and love it!! Don't make pasta or pizza without it!	1
I had bought this for my grandson because I loved the one I had.	1
I had never tried these before but they will become one of my regular treats because they are really good!  I love the fruity taste.  And they are chewy and satisfying.	1
I had no idea that lean hamburger could be used for making jerky.  This Jerky Works Kit is amazing - makes it so easy!	1
I had previously bought a Nesco dehydrator, which I really like and was experimenting with various home recipes, but I bought this batch of spce works and they are great.  And a lot less hassle.  I know it sounds like I work for the company, but I have this habit that if I like something, I like to let the world know  --  Larry	1
I had TB when I lived in Mexico in l970/71/72.  I used eucalyptus/licorice tea and actually cured myself.  Since that time, I have used this tea every day as I love the taste of it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their lungs.	1
I had this coffee at a restaurant and had to have the waitress tell me the name so I could buy it. Simply put, this coffee tastes like it smells without the bitter taste most coffee has. I put it in my Keurig reusable filter and drink it a few times a day. I have to drink my coffee black recently and I really prefer it with lots of cream and sugar. To offset the bitter taste I would use flavored coffee. I don't have to do that with this brand. It's. That. Good.	1
I had to buy another of these. I let my grand kids use them for their mud pies. Perfect for kids to decorate cupcakes etc.	1
I had to have these Sprinkles!It's a rare color to find & I love it!Looks beautiful on Cakes!	1
I had using a different type of seasoning for years when i couldn't find it amywhere anymore. I found this on ole faithful Amazon and it satisfies. Ive been selling beef jerky at work and everyone seems to love it. Its making great tasting jerky and me money.	1
I HATE the Wilton colored chocolate (sorry Wilton).  I use these colors in Merckens and the colors come out vibrant, and with the high quality of the Merckens wafers, the colors are evenly mixed in the chocolate.	1
I have a Briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot. I have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema. Enjoy!	1
I have a lung condition and drink this every morning.  It does take a while to aquire the taste of the tea.	1
I have a puppy and use this product to spray on the brown spots she leaves on my lawn. The color is perfect and I don't have to worry about environmental or health issues because it is edible! My lawn looks great.	1
I have allergy-induced asthma. Perhaps this particular type is not affected by tea, because I see no change. However, this is my favorite tea ever. I have many tea-boxes that sit in my cabinets for years. This box lasts for a month before I have to replace. Anise/licorice root is wonderful!	1
I have always been a PowerBar fan. This the best I have ever had!! It has a very fruity flavor and was chewy, in a pleasing sort of way. It worked quite well as appetite suppressant. School is still out on it's energizing powers. The taste was great.	1
I have always used the  Wilton icing colors and they have lasted for many years.  Time to update.  Always perfect.	1
I have asthma and allergies and I find that this herbal blend really helps with my breathing, clearing my nose and chest.  It is a bland flavor, so I add an herbal tea bag - usually a blueberry blend along with the breathe easy for taste.	1
I have asthma and I believe this tea to be of benefit...the ingredients contain many of the herbs which are recommended for better breathing	1
I have asthma since young and after trying this tea...I felt that I am able to breathe better... Will try To drink more and see whether I will have lesser recurrence.	1
I have asthma, and this tea is a godsend. If you come to my house with any hint of respiratory illness, you can expect to have a mug of breathe easy tea set in front of you, whether you asked for it or not. The second you take a sip, it's like your whole chest just relaxes and opens up!	1
I have been buying Chef Prudhomme's spices for well over a year.  I am never disappointed with them.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic, Meat Magic and even though it's not part of this pack I buy the toasted onion and garlic.  It's great when I bake fresh vegetables.  Before purchasing from Amazon compare the prices with his website because sometimes they are cheaper.	1
I have been converted into a guzoline brain! Anytime I want to screech off to reach the speed limit I spray on to be so shiny and chrome. Oh yes, Valhalla (ah hem my salary paying job) will come as I cruise in with my civic. Hopefully the other war boys and war girls would be chrome and shiny too. A must buy!	1
I have been craving for green curry and decided to make it myself so I can adjust the spice level myself and put what vegetables I liked.  Just a reminder the green curry itself is very spicy,  so add small amounts at a time. If you can find it, use the Mae ploy coconut milk/cream too.	1
I have been eating powerbars for a really long time. I am a runner, and got board with the other flavors. This is my favorite flavor yet. fruity taste and smooth.	1
I have been looking for large packs from Costco for some time and never find them.  They always have mixed flavors. I love Cinnamint and I plan on having a regular reorder. A++ on this one folks.	1
I have been making beef jerky for about 20 years and this is the only product I will purchase. Everyone says that my beef jerky is better than any other jerky they have tasted (I do add other ingredients to my marinate).  I would never consider purchasing another product. Every year I make beef, and sometimes venison, jerky for gifts and everyone looks forward to it. They immediately rip open the packages and start eating it up!	1
I have been making turkey jerky using Nesco for nearly 20 years now.  I always make a batch of Original and vary  the other batch.  The other flavors are always met with mixed reviews by family and friends, but the Original is always a hit.  I can never go wrong when I make Original.  I have tried other brands, but I always come back to the Nesco because the flavors are bold and they have something for everyone.	1
I have been making venison jerky for years and have tried many different recipes. I got Nesco original flavor for the first time with a dehydrator as a present. I still mix it up from time to time but this is my tried and true seasoning. Everyone who tries it likes it. I have not tried the teriyaki or the garlic and cracked pepper yet but the hot is exactly that, hot.	1
I have been searching for these bars for awhile and thankfully I found them. Excellent quality and fast service from this vendor - would definitely recommend.	1
I have been using power bars for years, and I still love them. They are great for bicycling and running.	1
I have been using this brand of seasoning along with some added spices I like to make Deer jerky, I can no longer find it in Walmart stores and luckily found it on line and at a better price than Walmart used to sell it for years ago.	1
I have been using this for years! Great on tortellini with just some olive oil. Adds great flavor to any pasta or garlic bread. A staple in my kitchen.	1
I have been using this for years.  Great Product	1
I have been using this product for 3 yrs and it remains a favorite.  I adds a great flavor to the jerky, it is very easy to use and there is a fair quantity of each flavor.	1
I have bought several brands of Piroulines and thease are the best Dark Chocolate wafers I've ever had.	1
I have bought this product many times and it is soooo goood! Shipping was perfect and product was fresh and delicious. Just don't use too much of it. A light-medium coating is perfect. If it starts to cake up then it gets to salty/spicy. I put it in a bag with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and then shake-n-bake. My favorite!	1
I have een making jerky for over thirty years,i seen a display of the nesco jerky mix in walmart a few years back and bought abox. its was the best jerky i have ever eaten, my three girls never like deer meat but i cant make enough jerky for them, i make around 20lb of deer burger a year. useing the nesco original jery mix . we love it. all my friends love it too.	1
I have experimented with many different jerky seasonings and this is by far our favorite!  We make venison jerky on a regular basis and this seasoning is wonderful.	1
I have gotten 3 boxes and will be getting more. I add pepper after I have pressed out my strips. Good to go! Also watch on the cure package, it talks about adding water. I think it makes a big difference when using ground meat. ALSO use cookie beaters to mix up the meat to ensure a good mix of spices.	1
I have had some breathing problems for a few year and medication only helped so much.  I don't especially care for the flavor warm. I found that brewing the tea letting it coll adding a bit of honey pouring over ice make it quite enjoyable.	1
I have had SOOOOO much fun with these. I bought both sets and have used them on every cake since they arrived! OK, I won't forever, but I AM having a good time. It is so easy to make wonderful patterns with these easy to use design templates. I have a small bakery/coffee shop in Mexico, and these make uniformity a breeze.	1
I have had Wilton icing colors before and liked them  Haven't used these yet, but will for my holiday baking.	1
I have loved this tea for years.  I use it in lieu over the counter medications.  Everyone that I have recommended this to appreciates it.  The key to these type of teas is to drink them at the very first sign of illness coming on, and then drink plenty of it.  I am a huge believer in the entire line of Traditional Medicinal Teas.  Yogi also makes similar blends.  I like them as well.  But, you can't miss with this one for sure!!	1
I have low level Asthma (no drugs needed) but living in a city with horrible air and humidity is sometimes a problem.  I use the tea 2 bags at a time in the morning and find it to be very helpful in keeping my lungs clearer and functioning.  This is only needed in hot weather.Also love the savings on Amazon along with having them delivered.I will continue to use and recommend this product.	1
I have mild, allergy-induced asthma. By comparison to many, I'm lucky, my symptoms tend to involve a mild tightening of the chest, coughing, and shortness of breath. I am not on any medications because it is mild and allergy-triggered. Any time I feel the tightness, I fix a cup of this tea, and add honey to sweeten it, and it helps quickly by loosening the tightening, and easing the cough. Very good stuff, worth a try, but always a good idea to check with your doctor, first.	1
I have never used gel food coloring before, I loved the results. Bright colors , I had this product expressed shipped and it arrive by the time I needed it	1
I have never written an online review before, but I feel this one needs to get some positive feedback.  The product is great.  It does exactly what it promises.  I can keep coffee well over a month with no noticeble difference in quality.  It kills me that someone gave this two stars because it didn't come with the pump.  It never claimed to come with the pump.  It's a replacement canister, genius.  Hence, the name.  Once again, this is a great product.  Buy with confidence.	1
I have ordered this before.  Very good flavor,	1
I have purchased many Luna Bars but this one is especially good.  It tastes almost like a candy bar.  Very good.	1
I have purchased twice, and i will definitely keep it in stock. This has the best taste.I even got my grandchildren to like it, by drizzLing some home grown honey on it..They loved it too, I especially liked that it is healthy for you..	1
I have this every night. The bags hold strong. The flavor is consistent box to box time to time. They stay fresh in the packaging. I'm going to make some right now.	1
I have to admit that I bought this for Christmas and have not used it yet but since it is from Wilton I gave it 5 stars. It is supposed to be easier to use and use less because it is not a liquid. So will see.	1
I have to tell you that for me, this is far and away the most satisfying, mouth watering PowerBar to have 30 miles into a long bike ride.	1
I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy (excluding the Panag) and various other curry pastes out there. Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps. The Red has more heat, but the green has more spice. The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste don't really have any heat to me, but do taste good as well.For a holiday treat, substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry. It is super delicious (just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so)	1
I have tried different flavors and I always come back to the Original. Main reason being it serves as a great base or starting point for adding your own tweaks. Sometimes I add a bit of cayenne, garlic, ground pepper, terriaki, or some other flavor I want to try. Been using this brand for several years and yet to disappoint.	1
I have tried many brands of seasoning and this one is the best! Won't use anything else but Nesco brand. If your wanting a blend with more kick then try the Nesco hot and spicy. It's HOT!	1
I have used all of Paul Prudhomme's seasonings and I love them all. They are spicy but not hot and very flavorful. If you are trying to use less salt this is the answer.	1
I have used the nesco jerky mix in the past and was told you have it. I ordered it from you and I have the best jerky once again. It is without a doubt the best in my book. Only slight deal is a small touch  too much salt? However! It is still the best. I will be re-ordering again in the very near future. Thank you for a great product. Ralph E. Eskew  Newborn,Georgia.	1
I have used the products from Nesco for several years! I make jerky and send to my sisters every year at Christmas time.	1
I have used these food colors many times with Christmas baking. (I bake a LOT this time of year.): -)Excellent, bright, vibrant colors!Thanks!!!	1
I have used these on a couple different cakes and they work really well. It is easy to pipe above the pattern and it looks like it was done free hand!	1
I have used these sparkles on cakes and cookies for the holidays and wintertime bakery.  They add such a nice touch of glitter without being heavy or crunchy.	1
I have used this brand for years and have always had the best compliments on my homemade beef jerky.	1
I have used this many times and I am NEVER disappointed!	1
I have used this pizza seasoning before and love it.  The seasoning is just perfect to top any pizza.  A few sprinkles is all you need.	1
I have used this product to make beef Jerky before and it is always praised by those that try it. I do not switch to other products or try different flavors the original is the one for us.	1
I have used this spice works for years, It is fabulous. I will not use any other jerky mix. It took me several years to get my recipe right, but once you get it right it is great.	1
I haven't had a chance to use these yet but I love the bold bright colors. Container was larger than I expected.	1
I haven't made beef jerky with this kit yet, but have used it to stuff rigatoni with ground chicken and herbs.  It was so much faster and neater than doing it by hand.  I will also try stuffing rigatoni with ground beef or cheese.  Wish I had had this kit years ago. The kit comes with several different spice and I will try the beef jerky, when I get my dryer back from my daughter.  I love this kit and the price is right, too.	1
I heard about this product from a friend of mine in Louisiana and told me I had to find this product!!  I scoured all the grocery stores but just couldn't find it, so I went to old faithful Amazon.com and found it in a seven pack!!!  They're ALL good!!!  I bought my Mom and my sister the starter set with all the different seasonings.  They're loving them too!!!  Just this past weekend on my regular trip to Ingles, I found it!!!  Hope you do too!!	1
I home roast my beans and the Vacuvin is the best way to preserve the fresh flavor and aroma I crave.  This is one of the best investments you can make if you are truly serious about your coffee!Purchase a wine kit or marinader to get the pump you need for the coffee containers.	1
I idem is great. I love the taste it makes, of the food. It is so good, I want to reorder it.	1
I initially bought this from a local store. It was the best seasoning ever! We put it on everything. Spaghetti, home made pizza, potatoes, etc. etc. however, beware you can get the same stuff directly from the actual website for only 3.00 a jar. I have no idea why Amazon has more than DOUBLED the cost. They are usually cheaper but on this item not even close.	1
I just gave this beautiful cake topper to my daughter at her bridal shower.  She absolutely loved it and she can't wait to display it on her wedding cake in May!  Everyone at the shower thought it was gorgeous!	1
I just love the Power Bar Oatmeal Raisin bars. Now only are they yummy, they give me the get up and go that I need in the morning to get up and go.I'm having them auto shipped to my door. I get free shipping and they are considerably cheaper then in the store.	1
I just love this stuff! Makes the best Jerky I have ever had.	1
i just really needed there to be a non-mad max review	1
I keep power bars around for when I need a quick meal.I know some people don't like this taste, but I do.  I have it on auto order and always keep a box in the house.	1
I know I chew too much gum, but I really like this gum.1. At over 50 I still blow bubbles2. It has a slight mint flavor3. Still tastes like bubble gum.	1
I know this icing for a long time now,and love to work and decorate with it////////	1
I like all the fruit smoothie Power Bars. When I have been at the gym for three hours...playing squash, on the bike, lifting...I get pretty tired toward the end. A power bar....(and a mighty tasty one)really helps me finish and not feel so exhausted.  Yes it has a bunch of sugar in it....but that's probably what makes it taste so good.  Hey when its all said and done....taste great to me and works!!	1
I like it	1
I like it it makes my buttercream really white.	1
I like orbit gum and it is vegetarian friendly. This bulk pack gives me an abundance and keeps me from having to buy a Costco membership. Even Walmart doesn't carry this quantity packaging so it's a good deal.	1
I like Orbit winter mint gum	1
I like the gel color.  You get bright, rich color without using as much as liquid and the associated nasty taste.  They don't dry out as fast as the paste colors either.  Good value.  Easy to squeeze out just the right amount.	1
I like the original flavor, and wanted to try some of their other flavor. Teriyaki and  Cracked Pepper and Garlic.	1
I like the simple dual packs of seasoning and cure.  They are easy to open and mix.  The original flavoring goes well with beef jerky and turkey jerky.	1
I like the spices	1
I like this presentation as its nit bulky if you carry 2-3 gums in your pants pockets. The mint refreshing flavor stays for a nice time!	1
I like this product because it has different colors. The quality is very good. I use it for cakes, meringue and jelly.	1
I like this product very much and is going to order it again.I recommend it to all of my friends.	1
I like this tea and have recommended it to others. It really works!!	1
I like to have a Power Bar before i go for a run to give me an extra boost of energy..	1
I like to sprinkle o cakes and cup cakes. the girls love to eat them like candy. Say no more.	1
I like Traditional Medicines teas.	1
I liked all the different colors.  They were packaged well, and they were fresh.  I would buy these again.  Yummy!	1
I liked being able to buy in bulk.	1
I liked it I give it 5 Stars didn't i it tastes great it's not too spicy if you want to make it spicy then.  you can make it spicier of your own accord.	1
I liked the flavor	1
I liked these so much that I bought a second batch a couple weeks after the first one.  They're basically a healthy gummy bear kind of food.  I'm sure they're not the healthiest thing you can eat, but they're healthier than most quick breakfast foods, and they taste good, but they're really not that sweet.I usually eat them for breakfast on the way to work.  I usually eat bars like Cliff Bars for breakfast, but this is something different to shake things up.  I'll be buying them again, too.	1
I live in exile in Denver now - I couldn't survive without this bit of Miami !  This is the best.  I have a following at work - every Friday morning - cafe Cubano.	1
I live in Hawaii and nobody sells good curry paste here, which seems ridiculous to me. I ordered this, the red paste, and the Panang paste and they're all fantastic. On top of that, there's a lot of paste in them for a very good price! One jar makes enough for a meal for 9 with loads of leftovers.	1
I live in Texas, and I was please when these arrived packed with polar packs to keep the chocolate from melting.	1
I live on Breathe Easy and Throat Coat in the winter, when the powerful germs of my students overtake me.	1
I LIVE! I DIE! I LIVE AGAIN!	1
I live, I die. I LIVE AGAIN!	1
I live, I die. I LIVE AGAIN!Share this quote	1
I love all of the Nesco jerky seasonings! I've been buying these for many many years and will never get sick of it.I used it on some bear meat the other day and it turned out great!I usually mix hot and spicy 1 part with regular seasoning 3 parts to give it a little bite.	1
I love all of you, i just wanted to say that.	1
I love all Paul Prudhomme	1
I love all the colors that come with this set, but most of all I like the black. I know that there are black candy melts out there but there is usually a purple-ish tint to them the longer it sits after being melted. I just add a few drops of black to the melted candy and viola! A true black. I love pairing the black with pink for a really cute and girlie cake pop look.As far as shipping, they cam nice and neat with no spillage. ^_^	1
I love all these seasonings, they are the best!	1
I love Bob's Red Mill products.  All the grains in this blend are ground, so it can be included in a multigrain bread without more grinding at home.  This is a pantry staple at my house.  And the price is fantastic.	1
I love Bob's Red Mill, and their hot cereal is always delicious. I love this blend as it provides wonderful nutrients and acts as a great base for so many oatmeal combinations.	1
I love Chef Paul seasoning. Taste is amazing. I was first introduced at santa monica seafood. they recommend I try the Fish seasoning on my grilled salmon. Wow! Taste blew my taste buds. It really adds flavor. The really cool thing is this set of four different seasonings has l;asted much longer than expected. there is allot of seasoning in each bottle.	1
I love gel colors! These work great without changing the consistency of the frosting.	1
I love it	1
I love it	1
I love it! Makes perfectly thin jerky every time.	1
I love it, a little bit goes a long way so I freeze it.	1
I Love it, I will recommend it to all my friends, good quality,and fast service. Good for us beginner bakers.	1
I love jerky and this jerky spice is the best I have bought for making my own. You cant go wrong with this brand.	1
I love love love this!! I used this on white fondant to give it a pearly look. It worked great. I need to order more! Left no taste.	1
I love Luna Bars! They are so good for you, and taste great. These are my favorite. The package came right on time.	1
I love Luna bars, and chocolate peppermint is the second best flavor next to chocolate raspberry (but 15 count box of chocolate raspberry costs way more and I can get them cheaper in stores).	1
I love my jerky. Great flavor	1
I love Orbit and this is my favorite flavor. I like that you get a ton of gum in this package. I would definitely recommend it.	1
I love Orbit Bubblemint gum and I love getting a good deal on it!  I shared it with everyone at my office.	1
I love orbit cinnamon gum so there is no surprise that this is delicious.I would like to comment that one reviewer said his pack was stale and I did not have that experience what so ever.	1
I love Power Bars. I have no idea if by eating them you can improve your performance but they taste really great.But be warned, if you have a lot of them at home, you will keep eating them till they are gone.	1
I love Prudhomme's seasonings. I use the seafood and meat magic the most. The container labels were revised from those I purchased a few years ago, but the ingredients did not change.	1
I love sprinkles. And all the shapes and colors contained in this Animals and Stars mix make me giddy! Great for my Cookie of the Month club, cupcakes, tarts, candies, etc. I love these!	1
I love Thai food.  This paste make my cooking easy.  One table spoon of this paste + some lemon juicy + some Grace coconut milk powder + a onion + some fish (chicken, shrimp, beef or pork), you will have a restaurant Thai dish.	1
I love Thai Green Curry.I tried a couple other products from local stores but I haven't found good one so far.Finally I bought this product from Amazon and I really like it!! Highly recommended!	1
i love that they're dark chocolate! i found these once in a fresh market store but not since then. but i was gladdened to find them online. i have one with breakfast every day and oddly they seem to cut down on my overall craving for other chocolate. which is helpful. : >	1
I love the berry powerbar.  Best taste of all the powerbars.  This is a good deal.	1
I love the coffee at my favorite restaurant and finally asked them what it was.  I couldn't find this at any local store and was so happy to see it on Amazon.  Very fine ground and a bit on the strong side.  Love it.	1
I Love The Colors...to bad the jars are so small. I make a lot of candy melts, and hope the jars get bigger, that way I don't have to keep buying these little guys. It's hard to find, OIL based candy colors for chocolate in a bigger bottle, that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, for shipping! I think $22 dollars for shipping, is ridiculous, for ONE bottle!!!	1
I love the flavor. We are huge gum chewers in my house and really no one ever complains about the kinds I buy but personally I thought it had a great flavor. Lasted about as long as any typical gum.	1
I love the flavors in these. Original is my favorite, but they're all really good.  I add more flavor to customize my jerky but these are great on their own as well.  Everyone that has tried my jerky have all agreed that it is the best they've ever tried.  25 packs is enough for 25lbs of meat!  I will be buying this variety pack over and over again.	1
i love the gel so much better. it mixes easy with no fuss. it only takes a little bit to color frosting and cakes.	1
I love the gum and the flavor.  What else is there to say	1
I love the mix and so do my friends. Very easy to use since it has the right amounts to make the jerky great.	1
I love the Nesco seasonings!  It is still the best brand of seasoning that I have used with my homemade beef jerky!  In 2 lbs. of 88% ground beef, I mix Original with Hot 'n' Spicy and it makes for the perfect flavor.	1
I love the seasoning blend of Nesco Original Jerky Spice Works.  It's a quality seasoning at a reasonable price.  The well-packaged item arrived within 2 days.	1
I love the Sweetmint flavor! It tastes like minty candy.Other than that, Orbit gum is pretty normal - the flavor lasts the same amount of time as other brands and the price varies a lot from month to month, so sometimes it's the best deal and sometimes it's not. Probably my single favorite gum is Five Solstice, with this one being my number 2.	1
I love the taste of Orbit Wintermint. The flavor lasts the longest of any gum I have tried. You can't go wrong buying it bulk on Amazon. I ended up saving over $10 as opposed to buying in the store.	1
I love the taste of Orbit's Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum!!!The flavor lasts, and its good for your teeth; including your dental work.	1
I love the taste of this coffee. It brings back memories of my trips to Europe and Asia. And the price on Amazon is cheaper than most high-end coffees in my local grocery store.	1
I love the taste of this tea and while it doesn't cure my asthma, it definitely helps while I drink it.  Highly recommend!  Getting the 6 pack its really convenient	1
I love the traditional Medicinals teas, and i especially love the 15% subscribe and save Amazon discount.	1
I love the way these make my Jerky taste. This flavor the Sweet Hardwood is my fav. I jerky usually venison and turkey and bother turn out so good. I just add black and cayenne pepper to raise or lower heat value. They are  a huge hit with friends. The sweet hardwood is just that, nice subtle sweet and smokey taste. Another think i will do if i want more smokiness is to add a few drops of liquid smoke. I have yet to make a batch of bad jerky with these seasoning.	1
I love the Zone Bars  It was great to have them delivered to the house.  I have not reordered because of the heat. I thought they would melt.  I will be ordering them again	1
I love these baking candies.  They added a nice look to this year's holiday cookies!	1
I love these bars.  I eat them everyday.	1
i love these colors and they are so pigmented	1
I love these colors. You can mix them to get different colors. Beautiful! So happy.	1
I love these creamers! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge (not necessary but I do) and just take out what you need. The price is the best here on Amazon, I first purchased these from another site and paid $2.00 more! I'll be back for more.	1
I love these seasonings and use them all the time.  There is a seasoning for just about everything I cook, and I season my meat with the appropriate blend whether the recipe calls for it or not.  They add a lot of flavor to the dish.	1
I love these seasonings, and the variety is really convenient. I often mix my own seasonings, but when I don't have time, I use the Chef Paul seasonings. I have used all of these, and they go a long way. I keep these and other Chef Paul seasonings on hand at all times.	1
I love these seasonings. All are wonderful! They are great on all types of dishes and foods! My whole family loves them :)	1
I love these- so easy to use and I don't need to get my airbrush machine out.	1
I love these spice combos and they save lots of individual measuring. They are as helpful in the kitchen as Minors Chicken Base. I'm all for convenience as long as they help me produce delicious nutritious meals. These arrived quickly and well packed.	1
I love these spices.  So does my entire family.  I have made several pounds of jerky with these.  They make it easy by using hamburger and they taste great.  I like original the best, but the other flavors are also fun to try.	1
I love these things, however I must warn you they can become additive!! LOL	1
I love these things. I take them when I travel abroad and they save me on long flights and between meals	1
I love these, just wish I was able to get the tropical flavor. Very difficult to find these bars in store.	1
I love this cereal. I don't cover it when I put it in the microwave -- this keeps it from boiling over -- and it still tastes excellent. It has a bit of a gelatinous consistency once heated. I like to add a splash of milk, some fruit, and honey, mix them all in well. Delicious!!	1
I love this flavor of jerky seasoning! I usually let it marinate for about 24 hours in a vacuum sealed bag and give it a little shake every 6-8 hours if possible to loosen some of the mixture up. If you add a little bit of pepper flakes before marinating it will give it a great sweet smokey kick.	1
I love this flavor.  Product is always fresh.	1
I love this flavor. It's sweet, but not overly sweet like the sweetmint flavor. It's also minty, but not too much like the peppermint flavor. It also doesn't fall apart like the sweet mint, and it keeps its shape for a long time. It's so good I'll buy it in bulk!	1
I Love this for making a buttery icing nice and white, I use this product regularly for my white icing.	1
I love this gum and I am sad to see a single, mostly irrelevant review knocking the rating of this gum down near two and a half stars. If you know and love this gum please take the time to rate it.	1
I LOVE this gum!  It arrived fresh and dry.	1
I love this gum! holds flavor better than any other cinnamon gum I've tried	1
I LOVE this gum!! It's the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I found it here, since I can't get it at a certain store anymore. It's cheaper than buying a couple of packs at a time from a gas station. I'm just happy I found my favorite gum again!!	1
I love this gum.  It is the best gum on the market.	1
I love this gum. Great flavor, relatively inexpensive price. Buying in bulk really lets you save a lot! And they last a long time.	1
I love this gum. It is so yummy and I can chew it all day long. For some reason, it is becoming more difficult to find this flavor in stores, so this big package is perfect. Plus overall, it is cheaper and more convenient to buy this way.	1
I love this gum. The price value of the 55 count Bubblemint is surpassed only by its flavor. I like to keep these in my car for after meals or before going to work, meeting people etc... It is very refreshing and I have to try hard to not have too many in one day. In my experience these last a long time without losing their flavor as long as you keep the lid secured. I have had them after about a month and they are not stale. The flavor seems to last forever, even after 30 minutes to an hour.	1
I love this gum. This does not have a strong mint flavor but its sweet with little mint flavor.	1
I love this item so much fun to decorate cakes and makes them look professional like I spent hours getting them perfetly even.	1
I love this jerky seasoning the best thank you yummo	1
I love this jerky seasoning!  If you have a dehydrator and have not used this brand yet be sure you do, you will not be disappointed.	1
I love this jerky seasoning! I've been making hamburger jerky with this seasoning for over 12 years. I don't like highly seasoned or hot seasonings and this Original Flavor is perfect. I do sometimes add 1 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper for a little heat. When I called the company this summer to ask about a lower sodium product, they told me I could use 1 cure packet to 2 lbs. of ground meat. I haven't had a chance to try that, but I will the next time I make jerky.	1
I love this multipack! The jerky comes out absolutely delicious!! Only problem I have is keeping the dogs from begging it all away from me!! Definitely will be buying more soon!!!	1
I love this oil!  I love garlic and adding this oil with infused flavor to most dishes really adds to the taste.  For example, I make crostinis and instead of regular olive oil, I use Annie's and it makes them sing with flavor.  I even use it for the oil when I'm roasting garlic.	1
I love this product !!!!	1
I love this product .I don't understand why they took them off the shelf at my local store. I told everyone I know to try them. I will keep buying this particular one flavor .They have others that are just as good . Try the Lemon zest  Luna bar another very Yummy one . You can't go wrong with any of them .Try it and you will be hook .	1
I love this product and have a hard time finding it in rural NCUse it in so  many dishes - good add to store bought pizza	1
I love this product! I use it for all of my baking, frying, whatever needs!	1
I love this product! I've went through several cans. It's great for adding shimmer to cookies, coloring pearls, painting small details on cakes. It doesn't go as far as I would like in terms of how much use you get out of can, but it's still a great product.	1
I love this product.  I use it with pasta and even eggs and pizza of course.  Oh, yes, sometimes I sprinkle it over popcorn.  It came quickly and in good shape.  KayM ... 4.23.16	1
I love this product.  It works well for moderate to severe asthma sufferers!  I couldn't find this in the store anywhere.  The price is awesome for the product you get.	1
I love this product.  It's always consistently good and so convenient.  Stir it up before you use it.  It's easy to use!	1
I love this product.. First time trying these season.. I will continue to buy this .. This will be my seasons for now on.. Thank you chef...	1
I love this seasoning -- I have bought only nesco seasoning and the past original flavoring was a bit salty but this one is a perfect blend and has a sweet and salty flavor.  It is great and my entire family loves it.	1
I love this seasoning. It gives my jerky a unique taste that isn't found in most seasonings. The small packets give me enough so I can make small batches without needing to measure exact quantities.	1
I love this spice for our home-made pizza.  My daughter won a couple of different bottles of these Chef Prudhommes spices in a gift basket and when I tried this one I was hooked.  I replenish this bottle often:)	1
I love this stuff!	1
I love this stuff!	1
I love this stuff! I bake birthday cakes that are detailed for each of my 13 grandchildren. This helps my cakes to POP with colors.	1
I love this stuff, maybe too much.	1
I love this stuff.  I smoke, and this helps promote saliva production to keep my mouth healthy, and my breath fresh.	1
I love this stuff.  It's great on its own or a good starting point to add additional spices.  I like to grind up some rosemary, fennel, garlic powder, cayenne, chipotle or cumin!	1
i love this stuff.  love the flavor.	1
I love this stuff. I just add a few crushed red peppers and it gives it just enough of a kick!	1
I love this stuff. I've tried different season mixings but come back to the Nesco brand Original. Makes my deer jerky taste great.	1
I love this tea and drink it regularly.  It makes a great gift also.	1
I love this tea, and it does seem to help clear up sinuses, and it tastes great.  I should be drinking it more often.	1
I love this tea, and it's my immediate go-to for congestion. Works better (for me) than DayQuil. I buy it by the case to keep from running out.	1
I love this tea. I drink it almost every night.	1
I love this tea. It has a bit of a licorice scent and taste but it's faint. Drank it initially when I had a head cold. Still drinking it. A new staple in my cup board.	1
I love this vanilla! Because of the pure flavor I don't have to use as much to get the flavor I need, which as a baker is important. In exact recipes and delicate creations you want a quality ingredient!As soon as you crack the cap you can smell the beautiful notes of complex vanilla smells. No an artificial smell of flat notes like an intimation extract. I would never buy another brand again!	1
I love this variety pack. I always used the original mix. But since I found this variety pack. I will buy it again.	1
I love using this to whiten icing...... A must have for decorators...	1
I love Whoppers but probably not the best thing to buy when you live in a hot area like me. These yummy morsels arrived melted. From now on, I will probably have to buy them locally.	1
I love Wilton Bake Easy!  Was unable to locate Baker's Joy anywhere, so I decided to try this product, and am totally delighted with the outcome... no pun intended.  The cake just popped out of my bundt pan!!  Wonderful... highly recommend  to you bakers!	1
I love wilton gel colorings. They are very rich in color, and don't require a lot of gel to achieve the coloring you need. I recommend this.	1
I love Zone bars!	1
I love Zone Perfect bars and was unable to find them elsewhere for a while. I bought them on Amazon because they were available. The product is great, but I probably won't buy them on Amazon again because they are way overpriced.	1
I love, love, love this tea. It is my favorite of the Traditional Medicinals tea. It has a licorice thing going on and I happen to really like that. Not so much a licorice flavor but the chest action that it gives you. It really works. Also, this can make quite a cup of tea. I have one of those mega-mugs and this made even that size... maybe like 16oz?- with one bag, still strong and wonderful. If you are sick, asthmatic, or have a tight chest for any reason... go for Breathe Easy.	1
I loved the variety of edible figures wilton brand, however I think are a bit bland and tasteless but add a touch very beautiful in the forms that are used ... thank you very much amazon	1
I loved them. I still haven't used all of them but they are great!	1
I loveeee this jerky seasoning it taste amazing. I use it with ground beef, mix it up, put it into a jerky gun and on the dehydrator. Makes the best jerky I've ever had love it. I've bought it a few times and the price is good. Comes extremely fast also.	1
I loves this coffee - mild and great flavor. Not bitter.	1
I made a Police shield for my sons 4th birthday. It turned out great.	1
I made beautiful cookies, my friends loved them!	1
I make Jerky most every weekend, all year long, and love Nesco's spices.  It is just the right amount of seasoning	1
I make my own jerky and I love the Nesco spice and I got it from this site which save me so much money.  Nesco spices it quite expensive but thanks to you I saved some.	1
I make venison and beef jerky a lot and this is my favorite spice.  It's so easy to use because it comes in separate packages. One cure and one spice packet for each pound of meat.	1
I make venison jerky with this and it's absolutely amazing!	1
I MAY CONSUME THIS CAKE AND DEPOSIT IT INTO THE SANDS OF THIS WASTELAND, YET WITNESS IT I DID AND GLORIOUS IT WAS. THUS, SHALL IT GO ON TO BE EATEN BY HEROES IN VALHALLA, SHINY AND CHROME.	1
I mean its gum so yeah	1
I moved to high altitude area and had difficulty in breatkinh. it really helped with it	1
I need my creamer with my coffee and I use this when I travel. I bring a few in a bag or in my purse.	1
I needed colors to jazz up some almond bark. This was just what I needed. It was very pigmented and didn't alter flavors in any way. No drying up of the chocolate/almond bark/candy melts. It stayed smooth.	1
I needed something that would allow me to dye mineral oil without having the color separate out, and this works very well.  Don't make the mistake I made the first time - I used too much, and that results in a cloudy color.  Just start with a drop, and take it from there.  With the primary colors, you can make almost any other color you need.  It comes with Blue, Red, Orange & Yellow - but you can make Green and Purple as well by mixing.	1
I never thought I would do anything so SHINE as this.	1
I never thought I'd bake something as shine as that	1
I never thought I'd do anything so shiny!!Best product on the market	1
I never thought I'd do anything so shiny.	1
I never thought I'd do something as shine as find this spray with Prime shipping. Immortan Joe looked at me. He looked right at me, and said he would carry me and my chrome straight to the gates of Valhalla, where I... wait. What's that? Joe's dead?Well, hell. That's not chrome at all. IT'S A FEMINAZI CONSPIRACY! THEY'RE IN THE CITADEL! THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR BABY BROTHERS! THEY'RE COMING FOR OUR TESTICLES AND OUR WHEELS! AAAAAH I'M MELTING. MELTING.	1
I never thought I'd do something as shine as that!	1
I never thought making chicken green curry would be this easy. Now I just whip them up and it tends to be creamier than the ones i buy in my local Thai place. Price wise, if you can go to your local asian store, you can probably get this at half the price.	1
i never use any other spray. leaves no taste that would take away from my food and my cakes come off the pan with ease	1
I noticed a significant improvement in my breathing after having this tea. I purchased it initially at a natural co-op grocery. I had been having some lung irritation after being exposed to perfumes as well as automobile exhaust.  After that, I decided to buy more of it here at Amazon.	1
I often bake cakes and after struggling with them sticking to the pan I got this. It was perfect. Now, my cakes and other treats never stick. This is a must buy for anyone who has ever baked in their life!	1
I only ordered 1 and got 3 somehow. I've tried to find a way to contact them and let them know, but feedback isn't eligible. I have huge plans for this gift I have received and I can't wait to get in my kitchen and go crazy with colors. These little jars produce some of the most vibrant colors I've ever seen.	1
i order 50 pkgs at a time =====the best	1
I order it because I am making jerky for holiday gifts. and I know they make a great seasoning cause it came with my dehydrator.	1
I ordered several boxes of Luna bars and they all came together in one big carton.  They came in a timely fashion and in excellent condition.  If you want to know if they are delicious--they are.	1
I ordered these for my college roommate since I have amazon prime, and wanted to take advantage of the free shipping. It came right on time (after two days), and well-packaged! Luna bars are a great breakfast bar (if you can't stomach much in the morning), or post-workout bar. Peppermint stick is definitely one of the best flavors!! Thanks!	1
I ordered this set because I love Chef Paul's Pizza and Pasta Herbal Magic. I have used all the Magic Seasoning blends and just love them all.  What I like the best is the great flavor they add to food without being too salty and they don't contain MSG or preservatives. I used up all my seasonings and reordered them again and ordered a set for my newly wedded daughter-in-law. The Pork and Veal Magic is excellant on eggs! I highly recommend them.	1
I ordered two boxes, to reach the level of free shipping, to be sent to my son who is a freshman in college living in a dorm room. He loves them and they are a great snack any time of day, or for late night studies!	1
I ordered two cases of this product.  The delivery was quick, the product exttremely fresh, and delicious.  I highly recommend this product if you love chocolate.  It also makes an excellent gift.	1
I own the Nesco Snackmaster Pro Food Dehydrator and mix turkey burger with these different spices and family goes crazy! Can be used on any meat, doesn't have to be turkey burger.	1
I purchased a food dehydrator and made beef jerky. I don't like spicy, so this is just right. I used a high grade of hamburger and it tasted wonderful!. It's very expensive to make, but so, so good!! I would definitely recommend this.	1
I purchased this product recently for my teenaged son's recurring asthma--imagine my delight and relief with finally finding something herbal that not only works but works rapidly!  This tea is quick and easy to prepare, relieves chest constriction, opens up the airways, and clears up my son's wheezing. Thank you, Traditional Medicinals, for keeping us out of the doctor's office and steroid free!	1
I purchased this spray to use on waves for a surfboard cake. The color was great and it was very easy to use.	1
I purchased this to help me breathe easier while I'm jogging, since it am not very good and this helped so much! I am prone to asthma and a bit overweight (which is why I'm jogging). I'm definitely making part of my workout routine.	1
I purchased two of these sets of spices and seasonings because they are the absolute best seasonings around.  We love to use them every time we cook.  The spices for vegetables are superb and the spice for blackening cannot be matched, period!!!!  I highly recommend these for anyone that loves to cook on the stove or on the grill.	1
I randomly bought this at a grocery store one day and absolutely LOVED it. I put this in all kinds of recipes (even mac & cheese) and it works miracles. It's THE BEST! I always use a lot of spices in my food, but this is the only one that I actually find myself craving at times. When I only had a couple teaspoons left I added it to my Parmesan shaker and it is heavenly that way as well.	1
I really got hooked on the great taste and superior crema it produces, but I find it a bit overpriced compared to other pods. Wish Amazon  would put it on sale so I could stock up. Good quality does cost more, so I buy it anyway.	1
I really like these bars, great for travel, snacks and hiking.	1
I really like these colors. They mix well with frosting.	1
I really like this coffee. It's got a nice smooth taste, not too bitter at all.  Some coffee is either too sour or too bitter, but this was right in the middle.  A nice aroma and smooth taste. I get this over the Starbucks.  I will be ordering this again. It has become my everyday morning coffee. Give it a try.	1
I really like this set. I use it when I have to color chocolate for treats I make. The colors are very vibrant and and it does not change the texture or consistency of the chocolate. I've used it a couple times in candy as well. Colors well.	1
I really like this stuff, used it twice for jerky already..	1
I really like this type of color for icing.  Way better than the liquid you buy at the grocery store	1
I really liked the product recommended 100% I feel totally happy not hesitate to buy recommended ..... sending was done perfectly	1
I really liked the product recommended 100% I feel totally happy not hesitate to buy recommended ..... sending was done perfectly	1
I really liked the starter kit, from the eight colors contained within the kit you can created 1000's of different shades and color combinations.	1
I really love it	1
I really think this is a great product.  I was leary of buying it over the internet.  Worried that it might spill, or break open and get all over the other products I ordered.  They work great and you really don't have to use a whole lot of the gel. I bought it purposely because it came with black. I needed just a little black coloring and this safed the day.  Great product.	1
I received my kit and the same day made my first batch. They dried perfectly and we are still enjoying them. Plan on making many more.	1
I received the Orbit gum quickly.  I bought two cartons.  The gum is fresh and the flavor does last some time without the gum getting hard.	1
I received this as a Christmas Gift and have not used it yet, but being Chef Paul Prudhomme's it has to be good.  Yes I have used his seasoning in the past and that is why I can make that statement with out using it yet... Don't not hurt that I love Cajun Seasoned Food either.	1
I received this product within a weeks time being stationed overseas. The color is a perfect match for what was pictured.	1
I receivedthe product well in advance....the product was well wrapped...I will buy from this seller in the future...I was confused though...I thought it was 30 chocolate sticks..I was suprised to find 30 packs of sticks...my wife will be eating these for a month...no problem, it's a delicious product-well worth the price	1
I recommend adding a bit of water to your icing to soften it up before adding gel color or trying to spread it. The icing is thick - which is great for some aspects of decorating. But if you're simply using it to color and coat a cake, a touch of water goes a long way. If you add too much water, add powered sugar to reverse the effect.	1
I recommend it.  Someone wants 17 more words.  Therefore once again, I RECOMMEND IT!  I RECOMMEND IT!  I RECOMMEND IT!	1
I recommend this product for all your baking needs. This silver food spray gives versatility to any dessert whether it's cakes, cookies, frosti-VALHALA AWAITS!!!  WITNESS ME! WITNESSMEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! I Live! I Die! I Live Again!!!!! What a day! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!! WOOOO WOOOO WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!	1
I refer these over the grocery brand I used to buy. Much finer and more vibrant. Recommended. Also, arrived in ample time for Xmas baking despite my ordering them at the last minute.	1
I returned on Delta airlines on 10-8-13 and was served these cookies. I kept the wrapper to order them because they are delicious and will order again. The tins are great for quick gifts.	1
I rode swiftly into Valhalla, shiny and chrome.	1
I sampled these at the race expo for the Boston Marathon and I loved them. So, I ordered a case from Amazon and they are delish!	1
I searched high and low for the right kind of food coloring to use in my lip balm mixture.  I have used Wilton colors in the past and I have always found them to be of superior quality.  The packaging was good, there was no damage and no leaking of any sort.  A little bit of color goes a long way when using it in candy/baking and for my latest project that still held true with the lip balms.  I will buy this again.	1
I send these high protein bars to a monastic community of nuns. They have become a hit with old and young among that community.	1
I sent these to our troops in Afghanistan who wanted gum and I am sure they are very pleased. The price is great.	1
I SHALL BE WITNESSED WHEN I AM SEEN WITH THIS SPRAY	1
I shall go to Valhalla shiny and chrome!	1
I signed up for a 5k race across the bay bridge... That's 6.2 miles.  I can't even run 2 miles straight without giving up.  So naturally, instead of training hard I did some googling about what sugars would give you the most energy to run a race and I decided to get a power bar.  It tasted horrible, but I ran 6.2 miles straight and finished the race.  I definitely recommend eating these instead of training.  I give it my top rating as far as food bars are concerned.	1
I spent alot of time reading all of the reviews for espresso pods on Amazon.  Kept coming back to the reviews on these but was hesitant because of the large quantity to buy.  So glad I took the gamble and relied on the other reviews.  The flavor and ease of use of these pods is amazing.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase!	1
I SPRAY, I WASH, I SPRAY AGAIN!	1
I sprayed my grill so shiny, so chrome he looked at me! He looked right at me!!	1
I sprayed my teeth with this and Immortan Joe LOOKED AT ME! HE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME, I'M SURE OF IT!	1
I still like homemade jerky best, but this jerky seasoning is probably the next best thing and, if you're willing to do the work, a heck of a lot cheaper than buying jerky from stores.	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this product and found it very useful to the purpose for which I was using it. K	1
I thought for out of a box this was pretty good stuff. I liked it.	1
I thought I already reviewed this item but will do so again, just in case. These are my chocolate downfall! I love them and they can be hard to find.  I am very happy with the packing and delivery speed, muchless the quality of the product. Thanks!	1
I treated them like candy bars, but candy bars with a little bit of protein.  That's what they are.  I love them.	1
i try to bicycle commute to work as much as possible (~3 days a week during nice weather).  just before taking off in the morning i like to eat something -- and really liked this smoothie power bar.  it's not too sweet, is a good size, and has a bunch of vitamins (e.g. 100% vitamin c, 100% B12, 25% calcium, etc).  generally a good bar before exercise and on the go.	1
I use 5 of these with 2 of the lem for 8 lbs. must put lite coat of olive oil on pieces before drying. The best!	1
I use a lot of this tea when having breathing troubles.  It's not as effective as some prescription meds but does feel good and seems to help and also tastes good.	1
I use at least a jar of these every year for the snow on a winter cake, and it's great stuff. Very sparkly, but subtle, and doesn't add a lot of crunch the was sparkling sugar does.	1
I use it for candy apples and it works great. The white is very bright on the apples. I only use a small drop per batch and it goes really far.	1
I use it with aeropress and add milk. Taste just like starbucks's latte. I like it!	1
I use one of these everytime I cook and I love these seasonings.	1
i use the red version(sweet and spicy) for regular pizza's.but this one i use on white sauce pizza's and also i use it in butter\olive oil garlic sauces for pasta.it gives a nice zing to the oil and it tastes very good :-)its mostly garlic,herbs and parmasean cheese :-)	1
I use these for the movies.  I can't find them in the stores any more. Great tasting like candy but much better for you.	1
I use these post workout, whether after a hard run, 2 mile swim, or rigorous weight training. Their a great source of high glycemic index carbs to help replenish glycogen stores and facilitate protein absorption by muscle (alongside a protein shake; the bars themselves are low in protein). Maybe it's an acquired taste, but I love this flavor. It ain't chocolate, it's its own thing.	1
I use these routinely, nothing better. And so easy to order online.	1
I use these to color my candy melts. They work well and the price is decent.	1
I use these to color my macarons. Very vibrant, only need a touch and they are good! The fold and mix really easily into the warm egg meringue.	1
I use these with burger & they are EXCELLENT!!	1
I use these with my melting chocolate and they work great!! All 4 colors were as described. I didn't have problems with colors spilling like another reviewer did.	1
I use this as a prep before all my workouts. I'm an endurance athlete and work with weights five days a week.	1
I use this as the main seasoning for the tomato sauce of my homemade deep dish pizza. I have not been able to find this in stores anymore and am glad it was on Amazon. Great stuff!	1
I use this flavor as a base.  I add more cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes. Occasionally I add brown sugar to make it sweet and spicy.  About 4 - 4.5 hours in my Nesco dehydrator and it's perfect.  (When using a sweetener, really keep an eye on your dehydrator time, because you don't want to make it brittle.....unless you like it that way.)	1
I use this for a base and then add more pepper, hot sauce, and red pepper flakes to taste once it's on the dehydrator tray.  It gets very good reviews from those I share it with!	1
I use this for coloring macarons, and the quality is great. You only need a few drops to give rich color to a big bowl of batter, and the gel consistency (compared to liquid food coloring) is crucial for making macaron batter that does not become to runny. I've bought the same pack multiple times already and don't plan on changing products anytime soon!	1
I use this gum as a diet aid :-)  The flavor lasts a long time and is refreshing.  It is good for an after meal clean-up, too.	1
I use this in my whole wheat bread recipe. It adds a nice texture to the bread.	1
I use this on boneless skinless chicken thighs mostly.  They come out fabulous.  I have asked my Husband if he wanted them cooked another way, and he always says NO.I have also added this to spice up veggies, homefries, popcorn.Great blend and not overly salty, unlike most seasoning products on the market.	1
I use this product a lot, so it's amazing that I only need to use a littlE to get a great colot	1
I use this product to dye the water white in my very small outdoor waterfall and stream.  It works well.  It will settle to the bottom of the basin if not used for a while.  It does not attract bacteria and become smelly.	1
I use this product weekly and it never fails to amaze.  Use 4 Tbls. of green curry paste to 1 can of coconut milk, whisk together, then cook EVERYTHING first, and add the curry coconut mixture last.  Allow to simmer for at least 5 minutes so that it encorporates properly and thickens.  THIS DISH WILL TASTE BETTER THE NEXT DAY!!!	1
I use this spice more then I thought I would it's good stuff for a fair price	1
I used cream, and put it on a white cake and my husband just loved it. Note one box does one layer of a two layer cake.	1
I used it on Christmas cookies, and everyone was full of praise	1
I used it to make a birthday cake for my little brother. He was perfect in every way.	1
I used it to make colorful pancakes was so cool.	1
I used one package so far, the original seasoning.  Soaked the beef overnight in the fridge then dehydrated the pieces.  Got raves about it.  Wasn't too 'hot'.  I don't care for hot type flavors so it was just right.  There is a package that looks like it would be way to hot for me, so that one will get donated...LOL.  Makes mixing up flavors on my own a lot easier and a lot more predictable.  Highly recommend.	1
I used the red and the blue for my first project.  I had to use most of the red to get my icing to turn the proper shade, but that's okay because it DID work!  The blue turned quickly and easily.  One tip for using the red, if you want a deeper red, try mixing a little brown with it.	1
I used these as my soul nutritional source for the bike portion of my Ironman (as well as during my year-long training).  Enough said.	1
I used these on Easter cookies and a no-bake cheesecake, and they looked great!  Perfect for Easter!  I would buy these again.	1
I used these to decorate a sheet cake in order to give the cake a St. Patrick's Day theme.  The icing on the cake was green, and these sprinkles really looked nice.	1
I used these to make a rainbow cake with my kids and they worked very well. Very little was needed to get a bright, vidid color. I am happy with this purchase.	1
I used these to make bath bombs and they worked perfectly.	1
I used these to make powder for a Holi festival. The colors were bright and vibrant and true to the color dots on top. They arrived quickly and were easy to work with.	1
I used these to make powder paint. Worked great bright vibrant colors.	1
I used this for baby shower cupcakes and it made my life easier. Was easy to use and lasted a long time. Beautiful blue color!!	1
I used this in coloring white chocolate and it worked perfectly it didn't make the chocolate cease	1
I used this on Christmas cookies and everyone raved about how nice it made them look.	1
I used this on cookies which i iced with white royal icing.  This gave the cookies a special pearly glow...not cheap, but it does look lovely.	1
I used this on fondant when I wanted to give the car emblem a silver look. It worked great.	1
I used this to color some homemade play dough and it worked very well.	1
I used this to dye cake batter and it worked a treat! I was making a rainbow cake, I used just the tip of a spoonful of each color for the 6 layers. One boxed cake. Dyed it so vibrantly!	1
I used this to make Jerky with hamburger meat and it turned out really good. The flavors are amazing!	1
I used this to make venison jerky.  It turned out great!  The only problem was how fast everyone ate it!	1
I used to buy the Oster brand but can't find it anymore. Saw this brand and liked the individual cure and seasoning packets so I gave it a try. Just what I was looking for. Great flavor! Will order this product again.	1
I usually buy colors individually from JoAnns or Walmart. These are about half the size, but the price is unbeatable.	1
I usually buy these locally but I couldn't find them at the usual places. It looks like they may have been out of stock because the packaging is all new, now.I have followed the zone diet guidelines for almost 3 year. These and a couple other similar nutrition bars come closest to the 40-30-30 balance for the zone. Half a bar is a great 1 block (approx. 9 gr carb, 7 gr protein, 1.5 gr fat) snack. They're tasty and big enough to satisfy the craving to eat something.	1
I usually don't like terriyaki sauces too much, but this was great!  We used it to marinade chicken kabobs and it was so delicious!  I am ordering more now so we can make them for our next party!  I definitely recommend this product!	1
I usually make trips to Sams club or Costco to buy these because I go through gum so fast.But this is so much more convenient and lower price!Good buy.	1
I want to order these, but I need to know how many of these are included in one order exactly?	1
I was a little worried that the gum in this pack was going to be past its shelf life, as things sold in bulk like this sometimes are.  But I've been through three packs with no issues.  Great value!	1
I was able to get to Valhalla without a hitch.	1
I was afraid they'd be stale, but they were perfect.  Too perfect maybe considering how fast we ate them. :)	1
I was buying the variety pack for a while but always flew through the packs of sweetmint so I've recently switched to buying only sweetmint.	1
I was happy to find for a reasonable price and quantity,	1
I was happy to find this product.  Service  and product were first rate.	1
I was happy to see that the due date allowed ample amount of time to consume. I personally add fresh peaches, berries, or dried cranberries to it with a little milk and it is delicious.	1
I was impressed with how quickly this started opening up my cold-congested nostrils and even my sinuses.	1
I was just scanning the horizon, and this chrome spray entered my field of vision!	1
I was near Miami recently and loved the Cuban espresso. When we got home I looked for similar espresso beans and found  this one. They make really smooth, strong espresso and good coffee as well. The coffee has a bit of a zing to it but the espresso is just a great tasting shot. Very good taste and quality.	1
I was scary that the color will be too dark, but it's very nice purple color. I'm not big fun of cooking at all, but with this product you will always make it fabulous!	1
I was skeptical initially, but was pleasantly surprised. I used this product on candies as opposed to icing. Wanted the look of snapped chrome buttons on black fondant for a cake made to celebrate a bike club's anniversary. This product achieved my goal without compromising taste. Will definitely use again and strongly recommend it for that chrome effect desired in your tasty treats. Bravo Wilton.....bravo!!!	1
I was skeptical, but this worked great on gold medal decorations made of gum paste.  It adhered well without looking drippy.  Like using spray paint, I found it worked best to do a few light coats rather than one heavy coat.	1
I was so impressed with this air brush spray in a can.  I had used it on deorating my jumbo marshmellows for my sister in laws baby shower and it was so Btful!! I also added this spray color on my white chocolate dip strawberries and it was a big hit.  It just added extra quality onto the work I was doing and made it poped.	1
i was thought it might be a huge size, well, its actually normal. and we like this flavor and this brand.	1
I was very satisfied with what I had ordered and would order items again from this seller.  My boyfriend has made me lots of jerky with the deer I got hunting.	1
I was worried my war brothers from the Cult of V8 would shun me for this non-toxic product, particularly my uppity lancer. I am pleased to say I had good results.	1
I watched a beef jerky review where the gentleman used the spice. I've been using it ever since . It adds the right amount of flavor and makes the jerky-making experience very simple. I've purchased it many times and will continue to buy more in the future	1
I WILL DIE HISTORIC ON THE FURY ROAD. OH WHAT A LOVELY DAY.	1
I wish more places carried this flavor.love them	1
I wish there were more instructions. But it is really tasty. I don't think it is too salty but then again I don't put a lot of cure in mine.	1
I wonder if this stuff is addictive.  I used to buy it a lot in stores, but it's a lot cheaper to get in bulk.  When the flavor eventually runs out I get a new piece.	1
I would never buy seasonings anywhere else when the flavors are this good.  If you have never tried them, you should.	1
I WOULD NOT SAY ITS AS HEALTHY AS GREENS PLUS.EVEN IF LUNA IS 70% ORGANIC.MUCH MORE VITAMIN PACKED THAN GREENS PLUS.THIS IS TRULY THE DESERT OF HEALTH FOODS!THE TASTE IS INCREDIBLESOME OF THE OTHER FLAVORS ARE GOOD TOO.	1
I would not survive without this gum.  It satisfies my sweet tooth while keeping me from eating stuff I don't need.  I really enjoy this gum.	1
i would recommend this to anyone who will listen,we love it and will use as long as we can get it,very good	1
I wouldn't buy another brand.  I have been using this product for a long time, even when it was Consorzio's prior to selling the line to Annie's.	1
I'd give it a ten if I could.  The taste is great.  And the savings!  I made 2 pounds of turkey jerky for $5.78.  A quick look at 2 pounds of Jack's Turkey Jerky -- around 32 dollars.If you are dieting or just trying to add muscle, there is roughly 20 grams of protein per 1.5 ounces.  Considering its low fat content ... that ratio is hard to beat.Just ordered some more.	1
If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die historic on a fury road!	1
If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all. If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly.We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful! It tastes great (I enjoy it  myself) and it is an effective breathing aid.**of course this is not medical advice, this N1 experience.	1
If only this came in a large size. Love Organic products! I am slowly switching all our kitchen purchases to organic and this has been a great vanilla at a reasonable price. The bottle is plastic and small but the product has been a winner. I could never go back to the early days of using imitation vanilla!	1
If you are buying this as an aid to watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Mad-Max-Fury-Road/dp/B00XOX9QCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Mad Max: Fury Road</a>, you'll be entirely satisfied. The color is great, application is smooth, and the burning sensation of the carrier (which I suspect is alcohol) on your tongue makes you feel like a proper warboy. Strongly recommended.	1
If you are looking for a tasteful jerky spice that achieves great results- this is the spice for you. I have recommended this to others, and they have loved it as well.	1
If you are using this for a cake I would suggest coloring your frosting a gold tone to start out with.  I probably could have sprayed it with another layer as it is pretty sheer, but I didn't want to make the cake taste bad.  It's like any other food coloring, if you use too much you get a bitter taste. It gives your cakes a pretty sparkle though! I will definitely use this product again!	1
If you can't buy Wilton Silver Color Mist, YOU CAN'T DO WAR!	1
If you don't buy wilton silver color mist, you'll go insane.	1
If you enjoy Sweet Mint Orbit, this is a pack of 12 of them.What else is there to say?	1
If you like a good pepper flavor jerky, this is the best one I have found. The garlic flavor is a nice addition to the competitionbrand which is just plain pepper.	1
If you like coffee, you have to try Douwe Egberts. Tried it at an up-scale restaurant and they gave me the name of the coffee. Smell great and also taste great.	1
If you like Girl Scout Thin Mints, you will love Peppermint Stick Luna Bars!! They taste exactly the same!!	1
If you like green teas this is a wonderful selection. High quality.At the same time I also bought a small tin of green tea powder, which will last a long time. It's great to add a pinch to the brewed green tea.	1
If you like minty gum, this option is the best.It's long lasting.  If you have dentures you mightprefer another product.	1
If you like Samoas or Caramel deLites, then you will love these bars.  Cannot get over how delicious they are!!!	1
If you love coffee ,you should try this.smell good. Est coffe i ever had..	1
If you make a spaghetti, you'll love this. Add this during cooking and it'll make it taste extra great!	1
If you need to breathe easier drink this! As a singer I am always looking for homeopathic options....this is a great one...	1
If you want a full flavor, real-deal Olive Oil, this is it. I stir it in practically everything. It adds an entirely new and wonderful flavor to spaghetti sauce. I brush it on garlic bread. Uses are endless. Great stuff.	1
If you want some strong cuban coffee, this is it, I even bought an espresso machine from amazon to try this.  Very strong and very good.	1
If your a jerkey maker, this gun is the ticket	1
If you've never used this type of food coloring highly recommended. I've been using this Wilton food coloring for years. It's the best.	1
Ihave notused them yet, but how can candy or decorations be bad.  I intend to use them very very soon.	1
I'll keep re-ordering as needed.	1
ill will buy this again	1
I'm a big fan of decaf coffee and the Starbucks House Blend Medium roast is tasty and not too strong. I like the fact that I can purchase it online.	1
I'm a bit of a pizza connoisseur.. I occasionally make my own doughs New York style, mail order high-quality mozzarella, toss the pizzas, etc.  And I have to rate this seasoning five stars.  It's an amazing blend of spices and goes good not just on pizza but with spaghetti, lasagna, and other tomato based dishes.  I'd recommend ordering one.. you'll be glad you did.	1
I'm a bit of an compulsive gum chewer so having stashes all over the house and at work have turned into a trend.  Comes in 2 standard sizes boxes with 12 packs in each box. Always concerned with things like these when buying in bulk that they may be stale.  Everything was perfectly fresh and should keep me happily chewing for the next few months.	1
I'm a fan of Wilton products.  Rarely do I ever get something that is lacking in quality.  I picked up the Cinnamon Drops to use as noses for my reindeer cake pops.  They worked great, looked great and taste great!  Definitely would purchase these again.	1
I'm a jerky making novice but enjoy it to no end! Been making it for about 5 -6 years. I've tried every recipe in the Dehydrator Bible with my 9 tray Excalibur dehydrator. This is the fastest (Fact!) and most flavorful method (Opinion) of making jerky. Definitely worth trying. I also recommend you cut your meat in pepper steak style strips instead of slices. Marinate for 3-24 hrs. The longer the better 155 3 hrs.	1
I'm a kid at heart and love bubble gum and still make bubbles.  I need a couple a couple of pieces and I enjoy the taste and the bubbles!	1
Im a party planner and for a retirement party I did a beach/shore theme.  For the candy bar, I filled a tall apothecary jar with these Whoopers and just 3 of these boxes filled the entire jar!  Needless to say, I had leftovers so I was able to refill the jar another time for guests.It came in a non-reseal able carton so any leftovers I had, I had to transfer to a ziplock bag or they would get stale.	1
I'm a traditional coffee drinker; I take it black with sugar and sometimes with cream. I never drink cold blends or fraps or cappuccinos; I just like plain old, hot coffee. This brand and blend is the best I've tasted by far and nothing else compares. Unless something better comes along, I will never go back to my old choices, it's that's good.	1
I'm an avid cyclist who appreciates a healthy breakfast before a big ride. I get 6 Grain on subscribe and save and eat it every day. I use 1/3 cup Bob's and 1 cup water with some raisins or frozen cranberries, with the microwave on half power for 11 minutes to prevent boiling-over. Then I mix in protein powder, a tablespoon of coconut oil, honey, chia seeds,  and frozen blueberries. Blueberries work much better when added after cooking. Delicious!	1
I'm familiar with the brand already if your like me; one who really enjoys the taste of a hearty coffee then try this it's so good as iced coffee. UPDATE---Got my order from this company it was packaged well didn't taste staleI was hoping that the products weren't sitting around but  all in all I am happy with the coffee!	1
I'm giving 5 stars on behalf of my friends who liked it.  I couldn't eat it because I neglected to notice that it contains shrimp, which I'm allergic too.  Heads up!	1
I'm hooked on this gum. Flavor lasts a really long time.	1
Im hoping it will get me to Valhalla shinny and chrome.	1
I'm new to cake decorating and think this will go a long way in improving my cake. Looking forward to using it.	1
I'm not a fan of peppermint. It's too strong. Sweet mint has that perfect fresh taste while also having a flavor just sweet enough to actually enjoy chewing it. My husband chews this to curb his sweet addictions	1
I'm nursing and eating this for a good snack with high protein, they're delicious, highly recommend!	1
Im only rating it 5/5 because it made me poop gold.	1
I'm sick of scads of nasty toothpicks all over my counter when I'm tinting icings;  the squeeze-bottle concept is one that is long overdue and exceptionally welcome.  The colors are vibrant, do not have an offensive taste, and blend, in my opinion, more smoothly than the Wilton pastes.  You'll need to experiment a bit to get hues right at first, but it's well worth it.	1
I'm so shiny, so chrome... ready for all the other Warboys to witness me.	1
I'm thrilled to find this size of Wilton's food coloring--can't find this size in the stores. I will be reordering these.	1
I'm too old for bubble gum (if there's such a thing) but I don't care.  I love it and Orbit is the best and longest lasting.  Product arrived fast and well wrapped.	1
I'm unable to use peppermint-flavored products, and am very grateful that Orbit makes this wonderful cinnamon-flavored gum! It tastes great and freshens breath at the same time. Im really glad to be able to order this online in bulk because not many stores in our area carry it and I use the gum almost every day. Thanks so much for making it available at a great price!	1
I'm writing this from Valhalla so I know the stuff works.  Valhalla has lots and lots of gasoline and fossil fuels.  What are you waiting for?  Get a boom stick and spray on!	1
In case someone else has the same question, this will color kerosene. You don't need much and it still burns fine.	1
In love, product brand new and shipping fast and easy.	1
In my experience, this is the BEST vanilla shake ever!  I mean, ever!  And the nutrional balance is perfect.  I love it.	1
In my opinion, the Sweetmint Sugarfree Gum is the best flavor made by Orbit.  The taste is wonderfully sweet and flavorful and lasts longer than any other brand of sugar-free gum I have tried.  The fact that it is better for your teeth, being free of sugar, is only icing on the cake!	1
In my opinion, these are the best tasting nutrition bars available.  I have to stop my kids from eating them because they are just like candy bars but have 14g's of protein and lots of vitamins.  The do melt easy so if you pack one for a hike or for traveling in warm climes, be aware that they may be a little messy when you open them.	1
in spite of bad reviews iordered thia product .i found some broken ,yes ,but the product s i have bought in the store  had broken parts also ,maybe more ,and they were very delicious,will reorder some more at a later date	1
In Valhalla we will all be shiny and Chrome thanks to Wilton Silver Color Mist.	1
Indeed, I witnessed our beloved gyro captain being rendered asunder by pale warriors with chrome teeth shouting  I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN!!!. Never have I seen such ferocity from man,  unless you count savior that allowed us to escape the clutches of Lord Humongous and minions ...oh precious juice. The man who only now lives in my memory...The Road Warrior.	1
Irresistable. Crunchy outside, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate inside. Most of these kinds of cookies are made in Asia -- I like that these are made in the USA. Bought a box and gave them out again this Xmas to friends as part of a holiday gift pack.	1
It appeared to be in some promotional packaging but it was the same flavor.	1
IT BURNS OH IT BURNS WONDERFULLYTHE PATH TO VALHALLA IS NOT A PAINLESS ONE	1
It came highly recommended in the Wasteland Daily.	1
It does not make any off flavors on anything we cook with.  Cookie sheets, waffle maker, this spray can be used on anything	1
it is a nice item i have not seen like this item before i will advise my friend to buy it	1
It is better than i imagine. Every shape has its own room and no change to get mixed. It is perfect!	1
It is cheaper than stores. I picked it up from my house door. So happy!	1
It is nice for diferent kind of things, chocolates, jellys, etc. and I don't find them in my country at reasonable price	1
It is not salty, like most seasoning blends.  It adds just enough pizazz to anything.  It works on pizza, pasta, toast, rice, salad, just about anything that you can think of.  Let your imagination go wild!  This is a great product. :)	1
It is nutritious and tastes wholesome!We appreciate the product very much.We will use them for our breakfast for long time.	1
It is really good stuff. I would be mind if it was produce in bigger size. Color and shining are perfect. Highly recommended it.	1
It is so handy for us to get so many of our items delivered to our door. We are older and this is a real convenience.	1
It is the best natural way to relieve congestion of the sinuses. It has a mild sweet flavor and taken warm/hot sets great in the body. I have been using this for 2 years and now even my family use it, all very satisfied.	1
it is what it says it is	1
It is what we like!	1
It looked great on the cupcakes & it tasted no different with the sparkles. Got it cheaper here then in Michael's.	1
It makes very good tasting jerky!	1
It makes very good tasting Jerky, sometimes  i also add some other hot spices to give it a real zip!	1
It may be expensive, but it's worth all the money.	1
It opens nasal passages very quickly.  It also eliminates seasonal allergy symptoms.  Amazing!	1
It really worked and tasted very good.	1
It served it's purpose and I was satisfied. No funny taste at all. Great product.	1
it stains but isn't permanent.	1
It taste like its suppose to.	1
It tasted great like it always does. Also it is always real easy to make with the Jerky Works tool.	1
It tastes great! We had a problem with rough handling during shipping (I guess) and several broke.  But it was quickly resolved by the supplier and I am happy.  I also like the giant container which comes with a pump and can sit on the counter.	1
It was a gift and it was very well liked.	1
It was a gift. They enjoyed them all.	1
It was a good product but they promised me That it would arrive by a certain date and it didn't .	1
It was convenient to have so many colors in one container.	1
It was good. We have used it before.	1
It was grate I love the colors and that you only need a little of it to make lovely colored frosting .	1
It was great and so easy to work with. .  My whole family and friends raved about it. Was great on trips, and plan on takibg it camping.	1
It was nice to be able to buy the creamers in bulk at such a good price and have them shipped to where I needed them to go!	1
It was precisely what I was expecting :D and I just can't wait to use it :D Thanks for all.	1
It was the perfect kit of colors	1
It was well packaged and was exactly as expected. Returned it though after it arrived not because of the product just no longer wanted it.	1
It works great and does look gold. Spray lightly and you can always add more. My daughters Bridal Shower cake came out great.	1
It works or I wouldn't buy this many.Packaging is nice, sturdy and tidy.Delivery was prompt.	1
Item arrived as expected.	1
Item as described and delivered promptly	1
Item as described. Fast shipping.	1
Item as described. Fast shipping.  Would order again.	1
Item exactly as advertised.	1
Item is as described and delivery was on time. Purchased as a gift so I have no personal experience with it.	1
Item received timely & as expected. Would order again.	1
It's a big box of my favorite flavored gum. There's no complaints.	1
It's a great flavor	1
It's a lot of gum, y'all.	1
It's as he said, with fast and nice ship. Sure I'm gonna take it again in next time if I need.	1
Its better than chewlys	1
It's delicious; it's hot, it's easy. It's healthy and taste as good as delivery.	1
It's good product but,....look at here! It's not good	1
It's great, it helps to make my buttercream frosting more true to white than so buttery looking.	1
It's gum - you can figure it out.	1
It's gum, but came pretty fast. the flavor is really nice and came fresh, meaning the gum wasn't hard. It's a lot of gum, but its all sealed and show last awhile ;)	1
it's gum, good price.	1
It's gum...so what can I say,....ordering was simple the price was good and they shipped it super fast....thanks for the product	1
It's hard to find the bubblemint flavor where I live in single packs or triple packs plus I'd rather buy in bulk anyway! Great price and yummy gum!	1
It's hard to get away from salt, but these spices sure help making the food tasty	1
It's healthy, great when topped with sliced banana. Wholesome food with a glass of milk.	1
It's just an awesome spice. I wish that we could find it in the grocery stores. Every other of these spices are there but the Pizza Magic. I make my own pizza and this spice is the perfect compliment.	1
It's make the best jerky. The taste is awesome and it is easy to mix. It also allows me to incorporate my own recipe into the mix which is fantastic. I would recommend buying this product.	1
It's mint gum. In bulk. Tastes good.	1
It's my Favorite	1
its really good.  has a lot of heat.  just what i was expecting.	1
It's revolting and painful and makes your whole mouth numb for ten minutes, as it should be.	1
It's simple:  THESE ARE ADDICTING!!  If I could, I'd eat these things more than 1 time a day!  I limit myself though because they are full of vitamins.  They really give me great energy when I need it.  I have them for a snack, NOT a meal replacement. The are not meant to be a meal replacement bar, just a healthy snack - The website will tell you that.  Enjoy!	1
It's Starbucks coffee I love.  This Dark roast is agreat, bold yummy coffee that has the bold taste I prefer.	1
Its Starbucks coffee in a bag - how is that going to go wrong?	1
It's sugar, what can I say?!	1
It's the best decaf I have tried.  It is rather expensive but it is worth it.  I'm spoiled now.	1
It's the best spice kit out of the box around.  Make sure you're meat is weighed, and mix thoroughly and enjoy.	1
Its the only seasoning mix I have used since making beef jerky.  I add 2 heaping Tbls. for a little spice and heat.	1
It's true... Taste great on pizza AND pasta.	1
It's very white.  Looks great on my sugar cookies.	1
It's wonderfully hot and spicy.	1
I've always liked power bars even when they did NOT taste so good.  I'd take them on the trail with me while hiking or when riding my bike.  They are compact and packed full of energy.The good news is that Power Bar has gotten better and better at improving the flavor and texture of their bars!Try this one.  You won't be disappointed.	1
I've always loved this brand for its authentic Thai taste. Funny thing happened last weekend - I was at a Thai restaurant and ordered a number of different dishes to try. Guess what, the green curry dish that came out had the exact same flavour as the way I cook at home, to the point where I could have sworn they must have used the same paste. Of course, I didn't want to upset the chef by asking questions, but it just goes to show how revered this brand is.	1
I've been battling a sinus infection and a cold for over a week now. I was told by a friend that Traditional Medicinals Tea was the way to go. I purchased this and the Gypsy Cold version and it's the first time that I've been able to sleep through the night without being woken up by not being able to breathe through my nose. I honestly don't think I will ever buy anything else again. Two thumbs up.	1
I've been buying this for year  direct from the manufacturer.  Amazon is about  the same price but has free shipping so you save money.  This is a great spice.  Works best with venison.  Beware of the ho variety as it is VERY hot.  If you are using ground beef to make beef stick jerky try the pepperoni or fajita flavor.  I still like this one (original) the best.	1
I've been eating these nutrition/protein bars for awhile now and was thrilled to find that Amazon carried them in a bulk size which cut down on the cost of a single bar.	1
I've been looking for a pizza seasoning and read the reviews and decided to try it. I really is an added taste to any slice of pizza. Not sure what all it has in it but it is really good!! Next stop is adding it to pasta.	1
I've been making hamburger jerky with the Nesco seasoning and curing packets for over 10 years.  Without adding anything, the jerky taste fantastic.  I have received so many compliments over the years about my hamburger jerky.  This seasoning has made it so easy.  I'll continue to buy this and hope it never gets discontinued.	1
I've been sampling a variety of different chewing gums so far, and I'd say this is my favorite. Sweet, with a nice texture. Flavor isn't terribly long-lasting, but no worse than other gums I've tried. I'll definitely buy again.	1
I've been using this blend for many years. As a New Orleanian, I've known about Paul Prudhomme's products and how wonderful they are. This particular one is great in salad dressings, marinades and cream based soups. Love it!	1
I've been using this for years and have yet to have a cake stick. It is flavorless as well.	1
I've been using this for years. Once you understand the different flavors, you can mix and match. Their labeling of fish, meat, etc. is only a suggestion. This can turn a can of vegetables into something special.	1
I've bought a lot of this stuff. Like a huge amount.If I'm honest, I have become addicted. It has taken hold of me and I resent its absence!	1
I've dealt with plenty of food dyes in the past but this one is definitely the best. You don't need to use much dye to make the colors really stand out and it doesn't have a strange flavor to it (especially the red dye). I highly recommend going with Wilton over other brands for food dye. Their price isn't bad either.	1
I've decorated over 500 cupcakes in the last month with this and there's still half a jar left. A good value.	1
I've eaten Luna bars for years -- and love them.  This price point made me want to order them online -- with the recurring feature.  I wanted to cut down on the waste associated with mailing packages -- so tried to order 6 cases at a time, every six months (rather than a case every month).  I even called and spoke to a sales associate.  What happened?  A few days later, a single case arrived in the mail... *sigh.*  So the price and product were fine, but the service has a LONG way to go.	1
i've had a lot of powerbars and energy snacks and this is one of the better tasting powerbar flavors. great purchase!	1
I've had one for 20yr, using it yearly, and it finally wore out, I got this one in  September used it to make elk and deer jurky and its worked great.	1
I've made about 4 lbs of beef jerky since I've gotten this product and I love it! It takes a little bit to learn how long to dehydrate each thickness of jerky. But the gun itself has been great and easy to clean.	1
I've never used oil coloring before...let me tell you! This Wilton set is POWERFUL. Be super careful not to get the undiluted colors on your skin or anything light colored - this set is very concentrated and will stain.To get the colors that I used (light pink, purple, bright pink) I would have had to use a ton of normal food coloring. I literally used a toothpick to add color with gorgeous results. Still have tons of product leftover for future projects.Can't wait till my next excuse to bake!	1
Ive never used or made buttercream before so this recipe was very easy to follow.  Wasnt a big fan of the taste though but not really sure what its supposed to taste like.	1
Ive only used the violet in meringues and it did fade out but I was warned it would... seems like a great price for a good amount of colorings	1
I've ordered a lot of gum off Amazon, many different brands and flavors.  This is my favorite.  I think anywhere you buy gum, sometimes you get a stale pack or batch, but overall I've been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again.	1
I've purchased both the Espressione Espresso (classic) and the 100% Arabica.  My vote is definitely with the 100% Arabica.  The flavor has more bite and flavor (much more like European coffee than American).	1
I've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor. I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand. Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green, Red, and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types.	1
I've tried all the Orbit gums and this is my favorite. Better than most gums out there.	1
I've tried Luna bars in the past before, and wasn't impressed by the texture.  I found several of the flavors rather dry and overly sweet.  However, I revisited Luna bars due to a crazy sweet craving I was having, and decided to try Chocolate Raspberry.  Yum, yum!  This has to be the best tasting Luna bar that I've ever tried.  It is very chocolatey with a nice sweet/tart bite of raspberry flavor.	1
I've tried many brands of jerky cure but this is the best tasting and easiest to make. I've made great jerky with both ground beef and venison. It also works perfectly with whole sliced meats.	1
I've tried other Jerky spices, but always come back to Nesco because it has the best flavor.	1
I've tried several jerky seasoning recipe packages, but Nesco has been my favorite, and my friends' favorite - you can always add some pepper or garlic or fried pineapple to it if you want to, but the original blend is what I like better than any others.	1
I've tried them all, and by far, Espressione 100% Arabica is exquisite.  The pods are so easy to use in my espresso maker, and they literally last forever.  I found a batch that had expired in 2006, and they brewed up just like new.  Superb!	1
I've used High Mountain and Nesco jerky seasoning and I do have to say I prefer Nesco over others I've tried.  One thing I have noticed is if you mix the seasonings and use it right away, using the whole cure packet is ok, if you mix it and let it set overnight it gets very salty so my advise is if you plan to let it marinate overnight only use 1/2 to 2/3 of the cure.  Other than that all the flavors I've used are very good and I would recommend it to anyone making jerky.	1
I've used Power bars for several years now and when I saw this deal in Amazon for a total of 30% off with the Subscribe and Save program, I couldn't resist. And the bars arrived in two days even with the Super Saver shipping! Can't ask for more.	1
I've used the gold and silver for decorating molded chocolate, and it's amazing! Just make sure the chocolate is not super cold otherwise you get spotty coverage. One can goes a long way.	1
I've used these gel icing colors and have been very pleased by the deep colors - allowing for just a small amount to produce rich colors!	1
I've used these Sparkles many times in different colors.  They add that little something extra  to my cookies.	1
I've used this a lot recently in some of my chicken dishes. I don't use a lot, I do like spicy foods and a little goes a long way. The plus is its in a bag and you can squeeze out what you need.. Yes I will buy more	1
I've used this for years but my local grocery stores don't carry it anymore. It's great with any pasta dish & I put it on all pizzas! I use this for all dishes that call for Italian seasoning. It works great for a variety of casseroles too.	1
I've used this product for years and I find that it is the best.  I have tried several others but I always come back to this one.	1
I've used this product for years; very good for deer, elk or moose. I mix my game meat half and half with beef burger. No need to add any other ingredients.	1
I've used this to color fondant for three cakes so far & the color is really great. You get the depth of the color you are looking for. Just a hint of color gives you so much mileage. Worth the $$ !	1
just a teaspoon of it does a job for 18 cupcakes..	1
Just a tiny drop of this food dye goes a LONG way. I add it to my cakes and cookies by dipping the tip of a toothpick in the dye and then stirring the toothpick in the dough. That's it. They come in individually sealed little screw top jars. Don't get the dye on your fingers because they stain. They are made in the USA.	1
Just amazing and so much fun to look at! We are gong to have so much fun baking and eating!	1
just as advertised very nice just as described don't make me write a bunch of stuff I don't have time	1
Just as decribed.  Love these bars and do not have to travel to the store to find out that they are out.  Will def order again.	1
Just as promised, timely arrival.	1
Just before my uncle passed he told with me his secret recipe for great jerky. Nesco original. Who would have thunk it? I've been making jerky for more than 25 years. Ground Venison jerky is unbelievably flavorful. Everyone loves it!! We give it a little kick with 1 tablespoon per pound of red pepper flakes. 4 hours at 165 degrees in a dehydrator then vacuum seal 3-4oz packages and into the freezer. Stays fresh all year.	1
Just enough to decorate one large sheet cake from Costco.	1
Just finished another batch of Jerky using this Nesco product.  I made some into Hamburger Jerky and some with sliced mean.  Love them both.  I would highly recommend this product for making Jerky that everyone loves.	1
Just great - my wife loves it!	1
just like I remember as a kid	1
Just like packs that came with dehydrator.	1
Just like the icing used on expensive bought cakes!  Perfect to have on hand for emergency baking sessions.  Buy it you will like it!	1
Just like the one at the store but better	1
Just like the ones in the store. Bright colored sprinkles great for King Cakes!	1
just love the colors, they look gorgoeous on top of cookies, My daughter loves helping me decorate cookies with these.	1
Just love them.  I think I am addicted to vanilla crisp.  Unfortunately for me,i have put on some unwanted pounds.  They are high in calories but filling unlike most other power bars.	1
Just loved it. Made it so much simpler to make snow icing.	1
just mix with regular or coconut milk - and add frozen brocoilli in a blender and so tasty	1
Just perfect!  It will be a great addition to out cake.	1
Just received colors are awesome just started cake decorating class by Wilton these will truly enhance my projects in class & home	1
Just received earlier today.  Will recomment when making my first patch of jerky.Edit: just bought another batch. This time I got the pak with different flavors. Made 4lbs of jerky for work and all of my coworker loves it.	1
Just received yesterday I can't wait to use will most likely be perfect.	1
Just right.  Tasty and simple way to make jerky.  I have the round Harvest food dehydrator and is simple and yummy.	1
just the right set of colors for me to make the best icing. this will go a long way since you only need to put very little to achieve the color that you like. doesnt stain also	1
Just what I expected	1
Just what I expected - very spicy sauce that I can use in moderation.  I dehydrated the portions that I wasn't using immediately and that worked out great	1
Just what I expected.	1
Just what I needed. Delicious.	1
Just what I ordered. Makes great jerky!	1
Just what I was looking for	1
Just what I was looking for!	1
Just what I was looking for.	1

Just wish there were more colors but mixed well into frosting...better then the liquid food coloring...colors are much more vibrant.	1
Khan Lee is Awesome.	1

Like a lot of other reviewers, I have tried making my own spice packs, and I have yet to achieve the flavor of this seasoning.  Frankly, it's just easier to get these and be done with it.  They can be a little salty if you use too much, but for people that are seasoned jerky makers figuring this out shouldn't be a problem.  For me, my best jerky has always been with these packets. So, why risk it? Just get this.	1
Like I said, these are delicious and the price is unbeatable.	1
Like many Amazon shoppers, I do not read. I shop based on pictures. Buyer BEWARE - this is not COLON MIST.That said, I still gave it 5 stars because my anus looks stunning all chromed out.	1
like the ingredient content and quality	1
Like the taste and my family likes it too.	1
Like the taste and the easy breathing after steeping this blend at least 10 minutes.  Definitely recommend the brand and this particular product.	1
Like the title says this stuff works. It's very chrome and definitely helps you get to Valhalla.	1
Liked it because had used it before	1
Live on these for lunch	1
lol my husband and my father in law love whoppers the 6 boxes lasted about 1 or 2 weeks in this house haha.	1
Long lasting mint flavor with a touch of bubble gum flavoring.  very unique taste. Great price compared to individual packs.  Handy to keep in the desk drawer without damaging the gum.  Also a plus, it is one of the few gums available that I haven't had a problem with it sticking to dental work!  That makes it #1 in my book.  FYI...Orbit Watermelon flavor also does not stick to dental work	1
looked great on the cupcakes and you could not taste any bitterness.	1
Looking forward to making lots of yummy jerky.  Love the variety of favors.	1
Looks great on cupcakes, Not on my car.	1
Los mejores colorantes comestibles	1
Lots of gum for a decent price.  I won't run out of gum for a very long time.  It was fresh, not stale and old.  Would buy from again.	1
Love all the  4 flavors in this box - have used prior to this purchase. Will continue to order and recommend	1
Love all the flavors. This stuff is amazing.	1
Love Chef Pauls blends. Very flavorful and just a little hot.Thrilled with the four pack because not all are available in the stores I shop.Hint: The Vegetable Magic is great on anything.	1

Love it so beautiful!!	1
love it will order from them again	1
love it will prob. order more with the more single colors and so many different ones don't have to mix to make my color I want. You don't have to use as much either it mixes very well,it's a gel type which was different to me but I really like and plan on ordering more so Thanks Again.	1
Love it!  Works great to whiten butter cream frosting for wedding cakes.It is the only way I know to get perfectly white frosting and still use butterfor that nice flavor.	1
love it! bright color and easy to use!	1
Love it! This flavor I find lasts the longest! And on amazon, this deal is great. Slightly over a dollar per pack with sub and save.	1

Love it. Use it all the time for hamburger jerky. Taste great. I will keep buying this one.	1
Love love love this sauce.  I put it on everything and buy it by the case, so we don't run out	1
Love Mae Ploy curry pastes. I've tried the red and green and find them to be amazing. The flavor is very rich and potent. A little goes a long way. Much better than any other paste I've purchased.	1
Love making beef jerky and the spice packages are very easy to use. We enjoy all the different flavors that this pack comes with too. I've tried other name brands but this one is the best flavor and doesn't cost a lot.	1
Love making homemade jerky in the dehydrator and really do like this seasoning.  Favorite so far is the original, have not used the spicy.  Mix the seasoning and cure with hamburger in my Kitchen Aide mixer and refrigerate over night.  Will be ordering more.	1
Love making jerky it taste good. Also got a rush delivery for free so was able to make as part of christmas presents to family.	1
Love making my own jerky and this really taste good.  The people I gave it too agreed with me also.	1

Love Starbucks, best tasting coffee!	1
Love that they don't have icing and they have raisins.	1
Love the citrus flavor, good price too.	1

Love the colors. They are bright and vibrant.	1
Love the cute colors and shapes!	1
Love the flavor and it tastes great!  I am a huge fan of Nesco products!  The ease of use and consistent quality makes me one for life!	1
Love the flavor, worked great.  I cut back on the salt cure to about half to two thirds the amount of the package because the first batch I did I followed the directions (one pack per pound of meat) and it was just TOO salty.  Second batch was excellent!	1
Love the flavor. I use it in venison jerky.	1
Love the gel.  So much easier to deal with than liquids.	1
Love the gum.  Great price online.  I bought enough for a year at half the price if not less.	1
Love the Jerky Spice!  Makes some awesome tasting jerky whether using beef or deer!  Delicious!!!!	1

Love the spices	1
Love the taste and delivery time.	1
love the taste it leaves on jerky	1
Love the taste of these.	1
Love the wafers, and the people who received some as gifts loved them, too. The wafers were packed so that there is minimal breakage, and they all arrived in tact! Love the dark chocolate flavor; it's not too sweet, but just enough to go well with coffee or tea!	1
Love the way they sparkle but don't bleed into the icing or change color.	1
Love the Wilton Icing Colors. They are perfect for coloring homemade playdough also.	1
Love the Zone bars but can only find them on Amazon.com.  Lucky for me.	1
Love their coffee and the price was a lot better than what I can get locally.	1
Love them ,good price	1
Love them all especially the poultry, fish, and veal/pork seasoning. Not a fan of the cumin in the meat seasoning on my beef roasts.	1
Love them so much I had to put them on auto ship. Wish the company would surprise me with a case! I mean I am a Veteran of the United States Army. Hope something good happen one day for me.	1
Love them, just finished making 6 lbs with beef burger, tried three different seasonings.  Wish this item was available with low sodium!	1
Love them. Very light and feathery. Beautiful color.	1
Love these bars! Healthy. I always keep one in my purse in case I'm running errands and don't want fast food.	1
Love these bars. A perfect snack that is easy to grab and is filling.	1
Love these colors for making my buttercreme colored for different cakes. The colors turn out bright and bold and very close to what is shown on the package. Like promised these colors also do not water down and thin icing. They keep it thick and rich like before. Yum!	1
Love these gel colors!	1
Love these hard to find seasonings.  Very good deal for all 5.  Sent one to my sister and she is inspired by these easy to use, tasty seasonings	1
Love these melt in your mouth candies, hard to find in stores.	1

love these! the colors are vibrant and work very well with icing for cake decorating! the colors are very strong	1
Love these!!!!! will order more tomorrow.	1
Love these.  Low carb, great taste.I've tried the meat and blackened steak so far, five more to go, if any suck I'll come back and update this review.I used the magic meat to make a friend dinner and she spent a good part of the evening trying to figure out what combo of spices I'd used...it's now my secret ingredient =)	1
Love these.  Very tasty.  I throw them in my work bag and use them for emergency good when I get stuck long hours on a job!  Plus they last longer than their expiration date as they are packaged well in aluminum foil.enjoy!	1
Love these. Good selection of colors.	1
Love this and the Red Curry.  Very simple to make.  Put about 2 tablespoons in a pot with tablespoon of Oil, heat it up and stir then and add whatever meat and veggies you want with about 2 cups of coconut milk.  I can have a meal in about 15 minutes.	1
Love this beef jerky.  My avid snowmobiling family keeps a bag in each backpack for a long day of riding its a great protein snack!	1
love this brand and all the flavor of Nesco jerky seasoning.	1
love this brand. I used to get at Wal Mart but they longer carry it.	1
Love this coffee! Altho	1
Love this coffee.  However this ground coffee doesn't quite taste the same the coffee I get at one of my favorite restaurants but it is still a really very good mellow (not acidic) smooth coffee.	1
love this coffee. smooth and high octane	1
Love this curry paste!!  YUM!	1
Love this curry! I used to live in Hawaii & they had this curry in the regular grocery store. So when I found it on Amazon, I was excited! Just as easy to cook & as delicious as I remember!	1
Love this dye.	1
Love this flavor. Can be hard to find in stores sometimes, so much easier to buy a big package. Well worth it.	1
Love this for use on our pizza crust.  Everytime we make pizza, we sprinkle this on our pizza crust.  It tastes amazing and adds that special something to our meals.  Also throw it in pasta sauce!	1
love this glitter for cakes make them sparkley.	1
Love this gum and great to purchase in bulk w/o having to go to a store like BJs or Costco.	1

Love this product a little goes a long ways taste so good I made a chicken and coconut Thai soup today!	1

love this product I've been using it for 10 years.	1
Love this product!  Always order when I use all that I ordered last time.  Great product.  Use it for cupcakes, cookies and cakes.	1
LOVE this product! I used it on a three layer rosette cake. Spraying a lot of silver at the bottom and slowly easing up toward the top for an ombre effect. The customer absolutely LOVED it and I had a ton of compliments on it as well. It truly gives a metallic effect without the odd taste!	1
Love this product! it makes your cake looking so fabulus! I put it on the white cake together with flowers, it was georgeus.	1
Love this product! Perfect for cake decorating and looks great. Just as described and fast shipping. Thank you!	1
Love this product! Started using it probably 10 or 15 years ago when I purchased my first Nesco dehydrator. We love all the Jerky Works flavor but the original is my personal favorite.	1
Love this product, can't find it no where around here. Will buy again.	1
Love this product, never will use anything else to color icing again. It doesn't thin the icing and the colors you can create with these basics are the best!	1
LOVE this product.  Too bad I can't find it in the grocery store any more.	1
Love this seasoning mix on Pizza, pasta, anything I want add add a bump too.	1
Love this seasoning!  Experimented with several online recipes but this was better than all of them.  I add some red pepper for spice and liquid smoke for smokiness.	1
Love this seasoning! If you like your jerky spicier you can add cayenne or red pepper flakes to this seasoning. It has a great flavor and tastes better than the jerky you buy in the store. Haven't tried any other brands, but I don't see any reason to.	1
Love this seasoning. Taste great	1
love this stuff for making hamburger jerky using 93% lean hamburger	1
Love this stuff- tastes just like the store bought seasoning I was expecting.  Each packet says it'll treat 1lb, but I've sussessfully treated 2.5lbs of thinly sliced wild boar just fine. After 12-24 hours of soaking, it dehydrated and tasted wonderfully after about 9 hours in my Nesco dehydrator.  Will prob try the variety pack next for fun.	1
love this stuff will be buying soon	1
Love this stuff!  Great on pizza, spaghetti, anything Italian - will definitely buy again.	1
Love this stuff!  It adds great taste and it doesn't have MSG and Preservatives that give me Migraines.	1
Love this stuff!!! I only need a minuscule about to change color of any cake mix! Going to make my twins a rainbow cake for their first birthday-these are perfect :)	1
Love this stuff.  Great price on Amazon.  Quick shipping.  Has me ready to make jerky for awhile.  The only trouble...I eat the jerky too fast and the cost of beef is not exactly low.  This is a great classic spice that everyone will enjoy (except those that don't care for jerky that is).	1
Love this stuff.  Read about it in a magazine.  Very spicy, but that's because I put a lot in.  I love that it is not full of chemicals too.  Awesome price and awesome product.	1
Love this stuff.  Super easy and tastes great!	1
Love this stuff. After trying others, I only use this.	1
Love this stuff. Jaw gets tired before it runs out of flavor.	1
Love this stuff. We put it on everything -- without shame!	1
Love this sugarless gum.  Helps keep the teeth clean and the gums healthy.	1
Love this sweet hardwood flavor!  Always comes out great.	1
Love this tea !!! I would Not be without it. I have serious allergy issues year round due to living in a Bad Air Quality state. I could NOT imagine my life with out it !!!	1
Love this tea.	1
Love this tea. It really helps.	1
Love this unique combo of spices! There is a wonderful undertone of anise. I can't eat steak without it now	1
love this with my frapps	1
love this, i was worried it was mess up the chocolate since i had to use almond bark which is not the best chocolate, but it worked great	1
Love this.  Moderately spicy when compared to Mae Ploy's Yellow Curry Paste so you may need to dilute more with coconut milk.  Very tasty.  Make sure to refrigerate after opening.	1
Love to use it on home made pizza.  Tastes great and is easy to use.  Good job Chef Paul.  Thanks.	1
love using the glitter on cakes, would love to get hold of some clear glitter, have used this before, really adds to the cake.	1
Love, love Orbit fruit flavored gum. This is a great value	1
Love, love, love these cookies! Positively addictive!	1
Loved it...made the waves on the ocean cake perfect...not to mention so easy	1
Loved the favor!	1
loved the price for this	1
loved the product, worked perfect for a kids birthday party with cars. Shipped in plenty of time, good quality, excellent	1
Loved the variety and the flavors. Would definitely recommend.	1
Loved the way the finished products came out! I sprayed molded chocolates I had made (after they had set and fully cooled) and the finish was perfect. I recommend you spray lightly and wait as the color seemed to develop on the surface of the chocolates. I made awards statuettes for an Academy Awards party and they were a big hit. I plan to make some golden eggs for Easter.	1
Loved these seasonings will order again	1
Loved this and definitely would order again.	1
Loved this item, made our Shamrock Shakes even more fun.  Nice product at a good price for the size you receive	1
Loved this kit. I liked that I got both colors I needed. These colors are deep and true. Made great cookies.	1
Loved this stuff!  It worked perfectly, and created a wonderful shiny silver on the cupcakes (with white icing).  I bought two cans for two dozen cupcakes - and still have almost a full can left.  I didn't eat any, so I cannot vouch for how it tastes, but I got good reviews on the cupcakes!	1
Lovely colors.	1
Luna chocolate mint bar helps beat your chocolate craving. They are so tasty. Moist chewy like a brownie. Thank you!	1
Made a perfect gift!!!	1
Made awesome colors!	1
Made cake pops with these great coloring worked perfect with the white candy to make perfect shades on needed	1
Made for fun decoration for Easter cake pops. Very small quantity though. Made only 1 batch of cake pops when I would have liked to have a few left over for more.	1
Made our cake look great!	1
Made plenty of icecream	1
Made some cake balls and i needed to color my white chocolate into some red and pink and it worked great!	1
Made some delicious jerky with this seasoning.	1
Made some ruby red slippers. It was perfect.	1
Magic Chef Paul	1
Make great tasting deer jerky, you can even add some of your own spices (pepper, teriyaki etc), but original flavor is great also.	1
Makes a great tasting Jeremy - we use venison and it is wonderful	1
Makes a seriously yummy lasagne folks. I love this blend!!!	1
Makes baking so much more fun!! Love the colors!! :)	1
Makes every thing taste like bar-be-que !	1
Makes for easy and tasty venison jerky!	1
Makes great beef jerky.	1
Makes great beef jerky.  Everyone that tries my jerky loves it.  Good and tasty without being too hard like the jerky you would buy in the store.  In fact, it is so much better than you would buy.  Also, the shipping was good.  I received it in just a couple of days.	1
Makes great tasting jerky	1
Makes icing true white!  Great for gingerbread houses.	1
Makes it really easy to spot a Warboy who is at the end of their half life and about to become a problem. They want witnessed? I'll witness their face with my boot, then they'll learn that Immortan Joe isn't a god, he's just a man who has been lying to them.	1
Makes it so easy to have great, spicy jerky.	1
Makes jerky really tasty.  Family really like the original and spicy.  Good stuff...will be buying again!	1
makes me a chef with no effort	1
Makes really good jerky!  Starts out tasting of slightly sweet teriyaki and finished with a nice spicy mild heat lingering jerky flavor	1
Makes the best jerky with ground meat. We love it!	1
Makes the best jerky. 30 pounds of venison turned into jerky so far!	1
Makes the jerky very tasty. I add ground red pepper to it to spice it up a little more	1
Making Jerky in my dehydrator with the Nesco Jerky Spice Works kit is so easy.  Just take a pound of ground beef (90/10 is what I use) and mix in one packet of spices and one packet of the jerky cure and put into your Jerky gun for easy dispensing.  I like the fact that the Jerky Spice is individually packaged so you can choose to add more or less spice/cure depending on the amount of hamburger you are using and to your taste.  Will definitely buy again when I run out.	1
making some now we'll see how it tastes as advertised and shipped early and fast!	1
Man this stuff is good! It's easy and delicious. Can't do better than that!	1
many colors for the price.	1
Marinating your meat in this seasoning helps you make professional jerky. I went about twice as long with the marinating time and it turned out very good.	1
Me and my girlfriend make curry often and this is good and spicy. We blend this green with red seasoning...sooooo good	1
Meets all expectations!	1
Meets my expectations, Sons love their jerky!!!  This product was received in a very timely manner.	1
Mint plus bubble gum, simply awesome!	1
Mitch has witnessed me!!!	1
Mmmm...fresh smelling breath wrapped in chewy goodness.  Can't go wrong with Orbit.	1
MMmmmm, spicy. With these you can make your own debris sauce. Sure, it's probably just paprika, cayenne pepper, salt and a few crushed vegetables but I'll be damned if I can get the mix as right as Chef Paul's people seem to every damn time.	1
Mom's favorite! Great selection.	1
More beautiful in person than in the picture (and I thought it looked beautiful in the picture)!  In the picture I hadn't noticed the bride and groom are both wearing platinum wedding rings a beautiful detail.  It's a classic and elegant cake topper and I can't wait to use it!	1
More than enough packages of 4 different flavors to make jerky - love them! Very good not only for beef jerky but deer also! Completes the flavor better than you can desire!	1
much cheaper than getting it elsewhere and really quality rub and seasoning.  Don't be afraid to add additional ingredients to make it even better.	1
Must have for adding sparkle to cakes!  The only thing I like better is airbrushing shimmer onto cakes!  But, these sparkles can be sprinkled on cakes, cupcakes, etc.	1
My 3 cups a day has kept my asthma more manageable without prescription meds.  Love the taste.	1
My absolute favorite flavor. It is the best.	1
My absolute favorite gum!	1
My all time favorite jerky seasoning ! Been using it for 20 years now , and buying it in bulk packs on Amazon makes it even more affordable !	1
My brother lives in Udon Thani, Thailand and says this is even sold in the markets in Thailand... how much more original can you get??  I know it will be fantastic.	1
My brother, rest his soul in Valhalla, looked majestic as he jumped on a vehicle with an arrow through his head and neck. I cannot wait to use this in part II.	1
My brothers were able to witness my way to Valhalla with this silver mist. It is very cold and does burn on your gums a bit. But soon that won't matter.	1
My cousin dorsher loves green curry and Mae ploy Is his favorite he doesn't need cookware just a spoon because he thinks its pudding, I tried to cook this for him with some dog noses but he screamed at me. DORSHER TO DUNGEON! DORSHER TO DUNGEON! I guess he feels like he's in a dungeon when offered real food?  Oh well. Mae Ploy Green Curry Paste.	1
My cupcakes are all shiny and chrome. I eat, I poop, I eat again.	1
My dad swears by this stuff so I started to try it more consistently. It soothes my asthma attacks and helped clear up a relentless sinus infection. I love the taste of it too.	1
My dad used this for his last deer jerky batch and it was delicious!	1
My daughter and her boyfriend both really like this gum, won't chew anyother	1
My daughter gave me one of the peanut butter bars, and I loved it. It also filled me up for the next few hours. I ordered them soon after, and both my husband and I think t hey are great!	1
My daughter is a good cook and loves the versatility of these spices and uses them in many of her delicious dishes which improves the flavors in each dish.	1
my daughter is just starting cake decorating and she said they will be nice to help her out at first.	1
My daughter loved this stuff on pizza and pasta, she nicknamed it Pizza Crack my local grocery stopped carrying it so I get it online now.	1
my daughter loves candy she would go crazy eating every candy and flavors she see it	1
My daughter wanted a rainbow birthday party and used these to decorate her own cake. The taste and texture were fine. They are colorful and come in a nice shaker. We have plenty more for the next decorating project.	1
My daughter's favorite!	1
My entire family likes the Wintermint flavor. Buying it by the case saves money, especially when I purchase through Amazon's subscribe and save program.Orbit gum has a nice long-lasting flavor. I would highly recommend.	1
My family absolutely loves these assorted flavors for making jerky.....they like to mix the hot n spicy with the original and it makes a delicious combo! It's just the best product for this purpose!	1
My family and friends love the original flavor packets. It all I use for my jerky. I used it on thinly sliced beef	1
My family cannot live without this tea.  We usually buy this from Whole Foods, butt it is cheaper and easier to get online!  Thanks!	1
My family decided unanimously to rub this on our Turkey for thanksgiving. Delicious! I put some on buttered noodles. I fell in love. It's good on pizza, great on noodles, and as of this week, great in meatloaf. It's my favorite seasoning blend, and I never want to be without.	1
My family goes nuts for this stuff.  I have been making it for years now, and everyone loves it!	1
My family loves malted milk balls and gave everyone a carton for xmas	1
My family loves this stuff. I have made all manner of beef jerky over the years, but THIS is the one they love the most. (If I could duplicate it, I would, but I haven't been able to yet!) Glad I found a multipack, because even though this has enough seasoning and cure for 18 lbs of beef, venison, or elk, I know I'll be reordering it very very soon.	1
My family loves this.	1
My family loves whenever I make them some kind of special treat, they enjoyed the colors and use them on ice cream. They are also kosher if that is an issue for you like it is for us. Most Wilton items are...not all, but most. I buy their decors whenever I am shopping for decors.	1
My fave cough drop. I always keep a stock at home. Specially in cold season. It's hard to find this flavor in any store.	1
My favorite  and addictive,  I have never gotten in a stale box here they have always come fresh. I eat them faster than I can buy them	1
My favorite coffee and Amazon offers it at a great price! I have it on autoship monthly 	1
My favorite flavor for a meal on the go.  I use these for a boost between meals and the vitamins in them are great.	1
My favorite flavor just arrived in time to save my holiday cravings and breath for family encounters! Arrived quickly in sturdy packaging at such a great price!	1
My favorite flavor of orbit gum-price for 24 pack less than grocery store and love the large quantity- I order 2x a month so I never run out- less than a dollar a pack.	1
My favorite flavor of power bar. Its sort of a neutral flavor and doesnt need as much water as other flavors do to wash down. I also feel like it is the least chemical tasting flavor.	1
My favorite flavor, and it turned out excellent!	1
My favorite flavor.  Be box store doesn't carry it anymore.	1
My favorite gum and love this flavor.	1
My favorite gum at a great price, what's more to like?	1
My favorite gum in a convenient, decently priced package.	1
My favorite gum! not too strong but gets the job done and lasts a long time!	1
My favorite gum, and this isn't a bad price.	1
my favorite gum. very original bubble gum flavor with a hint of mint. the mint is little not over powering the bubble gum flavor.	1
My favorite is still the original.	1
My favorite jerky seasoning!!	1
My favorite jerky seasoning.	1
My favorite jerky seasoning.  If you like it hot, this is a good one.  My sons and I both enjoy this one.	1
My favorite PowerBar flavor. Sticky enough to keep on your handlebars with no packaging for a ride.	1
My favorite restaurant uses DE - always great - so I ordered it for home. Super! Very smooth, with a distinctive flavor.	1
My favorite tea for the morning. Mildly sweet with hints of licorice. Wakes a person up gently!	1
My favorite Thai green curry paste. Nothing else I've used matches the depth and power of this.	1
my favorite wonderful flavor	1
My fianc loves whoppers and what a better thing to get him! a milk carton full!  6 is a ton of whoppers but over time he will devour them. Nicely packaged too!	1
My fiance is addicted to icecream and she loves me even more for getting her several of these for her bday. Great product and will buy more in the future.	1
My friend accidentally sprayed some in his eyes and now he can't stop saying : I AM THE SCALES OF JUSTICE, CONDUCTOR OF THE CHOIR OF DEATH!	1
My friend said it was the best jerky she ever had.  Been using this for years.	1
My friends and family think I am a cooking genious....until I explain that I used Chef Paul's Magic Seasoning Blends. We were introduced to these blends at a dinner party, and our pantry could not be complete without keeping this product well stocked. From fish to beef, this product would be difficult to beat.	1
My friends and I all agree that this is the best tasting frosting! Mine comes out beautiful white, frosted the cake with smooth perfection and set up perfectly for decoration. This will be a staple for my future in cake decoration!	1
My friends had us over and served us this coffee.  I had to come home and order it right away.  It is smooth, great tasting, and I highly recommend it.	1
My future son-in-law is an avid hunter so for Christmas I gave him a dehydrator and this jerky seasoning.  I have never had jerky before and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor...very tasty.	1
My gear needs to look shiny and chrome throughout the day! Take it from me (and I'm blind) this will make anything look and taste great on the way to the gates of Valhalla!!	1
My go to tea when I'm suffering from a cold or sinusitis.	1
My go-to gum for a few years now. Popped this gum in my mouth one day walking though a club, feeling like a fish out of water, and within two minutes, I was tongue wrestling with some random girl, who asked me if she could kiss me, thank you very much. I didn't get her name though. Then I got home and found out I had mono. Just kidding on the mono part, but only that part.	1
My grandchildren love this product, so it was worth getting on Amazon when supply ran out at the grocery store.	1
my granddaughter liked the various choices of colors and shapes to add to her baking decorating collection.  She enjoys baking cupcakes	1
My grandmother likes these very much.	1
My husband and boys love these as a snack between school and sports practice or during a round of golf. Easy to carry with you.	1
My husband and I have used these spices for years but haven't been able to find them anywhere. So happy they are back in our cupboard. The veggie mix is my favorite!	1
My husband and the kids love them. They are easily doled out, stay fresh in the carton, and store easily. A winner all the way around.	1
My husband gave up coffee and needed an alternative for his morning routine. As he has always had sinus/lung issues, I suggested this tea. I don't mean to imply it tastes like coffee at all, but he's totally happy drinking this now every morning, loves the taste, and doesn't miss his coffee at all! Plus as an added bonus, he has not had ANY sinus infections since he started this tea! He loves it so much, we buy it through Subscribe and Save 6 boxes at a time!	1
My husband is making jerky weekly and everyone absolutely loves it!	1
My husband is quite disappointed in this seasoning.....he said it was hard as a rockWe have ordered this before, with no problems.I don't know what happened this time, but it was awful....	1
My husband loves pizza and loves this stuff too. So glad we found it and that amazon carries it	1
My husband loves them!	1
My husband loves these.  Need to re-order	1
My husband loves this and so does everyone he shares it with we make deer jerky.	1
My husband loves this coffee. Very high end.	1
My husband loves this product! You can only buy the big packets in the store to make 5 pounds at a time. The original is also the best flavor.	1
my husband loves this spice	1
my husband loves this type I got it for him and he says way better then store bought so we will be coming back for more because he really loves it and he is a very picky guy :) shipping was fast and packaging was amazing even our cats think the box was amazing my order came in lmaoo	1
My husband loves to cook with this spice. For some reason we couldn't find it in the store. Had to pay more, but worth it.	1
My husband loves to make beef jerky and this is great flavoring! He lets it sit in fridge over night	1
My husband makes a lot of deer jerky and this stuff is great. A lot cheaper than any of the stores around here.	1
My husband used it with his deer meat.  It had a great taste and worked well.  He'd buy it again.	1
My husband uses this seasoning when he makes his Beef Jerky.  It has the best taste! Recommended this to a friend who now uses it himself.	1
My husband's favorite & got here right away.  Even with the slower free shipping.	1
My kid bought this to make his own jerky. We haven't tried any other brands so don't have much to compare it to (and he's only tried it with London Broil), but I can tell you that the jerky he's made has been super tasty.	1
My kids love knowing mom always has gum available now :)	1
My mom got the dark blue meat magic a few years ago.I always used it in burgers and they were the best! I couldn't find the one I wanted in the stores so decided to look on Amazon and found the whole set!I'm in love with it and use it for everything!These are the best spices I have ever used and I plan on keep using them.So happy that it comes in a set.	1
My mom said that it helps her with her asthma problem.	1
My most favorite mild and smooth coffee.	1
My mouth waters just thinking about this flavor! The flavor only lasts a few minutes sadly, but I only really chew gum for something to chew on, and also to make my breath smell great. This gum gives your breath a very powerful strawberry smell, really great.	1
My number one coffee	1
My order arrived quickly and fresh!  Excited to receive as this product is no longer available in my area.	1
My order was the freshest that I have ever had for Whoppers.  They are a fun product from my childhood memories.  They are very sweet, however.  I had been eating higher quality malt balls (from expensive chocolate stores) as an adult and the sweetness on these is a little overwhelming for me.  But, they were still fun and great to take to the movies.  If you like Whoppers, this was a great package at a great price.	1
My sister-in-law introduced me to these wafers and I was hooked immediately, enough that I continue to keep them on hand (thanks to Amazon's subscribe and save). A couple of these will satisfy your sweet tooth. The hard part is trying not to eat the whole can!Love the texture and taste. Great product.	1
My son and his bride adored it!!	1
My son and his wife truly enjoyed this gift.	1
my son had these when he was away at college, and they were his favorite. But they are hard to find.  We love being able to buy them here.  They do not have rice and such in them, and are wonderful! thanks	1
My son is a soccer player and loves this product and taste.	1
My son loves this stuff. Flavor is great!	1
My son told me someone at his work used these- had allot of venison so tried it.. Can't decide which was my favorite. Went back and ordered the 25 pack so I could also have the Pepper/garlic flavor. Better than some venison jerky we have purchased .	1
My spouse was meant to order more.	1
My spouse's favorite gum.  I don't chew it because I don't eat gelatin but he won't chew anything else.	1
My Uncle has requested this for his birthday, Christmas and just about every chance he can. He loves it! I personally don't drink ground coffee. I'm a instant gal, but I have tried it and it's smooth and different. I would buy it if I had a machine :)	1
my war boys are using this and having fun in vanhalla so i really its amzing	1
My whole family adores Whoppers and have for as long as I can remember. They're the perfect mix of malt and chocolate all in one little ball. What's not to like??The price here on Amazon saved me a small fortune on this batch, wish they have them on Subscribe and Save for this steal of a price...but I am happy to have gotten this deal even if not! Thanks, Amazon!	1
My wife and I both enjoy the flavor ...we'd been having coffee shipped from Hawaii and found this to be a much better tasting coffee for about the same cost ...We don't drink anything now but this and it's decaffeinated companion.	1
My wife and I have used Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings for many years, mostly the meat and poultry. When we ran out of the poultry seasoning we found out our local grocery store wasn't carrying it anymore. We decided to find it online and Amazon had a four pack with two other seasonings that we could try. The poultry and the seafood seasonings are also excellent and we highly recommend them. Thanks Chef Paul and Thanks Amazon.	1
my wife best choice gum.	1
My wife has asthma, and when she is struggling, Breathe Easy is one of the things that keep her out of the hospital.  Highly recommended	1
My wife has been a Whopper lover ever since she was a kid, so I ordered this huge amount.  She says the taste is just as she remembered! The candies keep for a good long while, and you can put the bags into heavy-duty freezer bags and freeze for longer storage.	1
My wife loves this brand and flavor of gum but we can't find it in stores around here for some strange reason. Frankly, I never thought to look for it on Amazon but a search engine brought it right up. When she runs out this time, we will be buying another case. Thank You!!	1
My wife loves this especially she's decorating cakes. Easy to use and also it lasts longer than other brands	1
My wife uses all the time. It is good stuff.	1
My wife's favorite	1
Need I say More?	1
need to order more, good stuff	1
Needed this type of coloring for sensory bottle containing mineral oil. A little bit of color goes a long way. Very happy with the results!	1
Nesco has the best seasoning for beef jerky	1
Nesco is great! Get this and a jerky shooter with a roller pin and make consistent and simply the best jerky with your dehydrator or smoker. If you are using a smoker cut your season use in half.(has powder smoke in it)	1
Nesco jerky 3 pack has something for everyone. I have used this mix to make jerky with 93% ground beef. Higher quality beef better the result. The original and teriyaki are very good, just the right amount of heat and sweetness. The Hot and Spicy mix packs a nice hot punch with a mild sweetness. I prepare jerky in a dehydrator and finish with cold smoking for 2 hours. Smoking is what take good jerky and makes it extraordinary. I prefer this to the original mix from A.C. Legg.	1
Nesco jerky seasoning is AMAZING. I mix the seasoning and cure in about 2 tablespoons of seasoning and then add to my meat. The resulting jerky is AMAZING.	1
Nesco Jerky seasoning is good. My husband makes jerky and loved these spices for it.Most of it was to hot for me, so he made me the mild.	1
NESCO JERKY SPICE IS THE BEST WE HAVE EVER USED!!!!!	1
Nesco makes the best jerky spices I have ever tried.	1
Nesco products are always good.	1
Nesco Spices is all I will use. The hot and Spicy is the right amount of heat. You will not be disappointed if your looking for a spicy/hot finished product!!	1
Never fails easy to make jerky with.	1
Never want to be without these! Good to have around all the time!	1
Nice and funny.	1
Nice and spicy!  Just the way we like it.	1
Nice assortment of Chef Prudhomme's spuces	1
Nice coffee, the same one can be buy at the store at a lower price.	1
Nice color assortment, the container is handy as well as it holds all of the colors separately	1
nice colors.came just as advertised.nice for baking cakes.i am happy with this purchase.looking forward to mixing these in my cake.	1
Nice medium bodied coffee. Not as dark and full bodied as say a French Roast, but nicely balanced flavors.	1
nice selection of spices	1
Nice set of food dyes.	1
Nice these colors are available year round, used the orange for a Harley Davidson cake. Came very quickly and perfect condition, very happy with transaction and product.	1
Nice variety of colors to create the exact color you are needing.	1
Nice variety of colors, and very easy to use. It only takes a tiny bit to get a vibrant color.	1
Nice, handy and very colorful. We sprinkle just a few on our cupcakes. Always adds that special touch. Will keep on hand. Nice not to have to fool with six different containers. Little lids open easily and close securely. Good product. Maybe just a tad bit overpriced.	1
No better way to go out chrome on the Fury Road to Valhalla. Witness.	1
No comment!This package the best.I hope the company make bigger canister's on the future.Five star for the spice's!	1
no complaints tasted great and lasted a nice amount of time..Worth the purchase..	1
No complaints.	1
No complaints.  Good taste, good price, fast delivery.	1
No issues...	1
No joke best product on the market. I have purchased it several times now and will keep buying Nesco Original flavoring . It's the only brand I have been buying!  I use it to make the beef jerky with lean ground beef. I cant keep it in the house or office. Soon as I made it, everyone has already started taking some. My three year old call it his happy chews.Love it!	1
No problems ... These are just candy color set as its described ...its used for coloring and thats basically it	1
NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER.	1
Nobody else makes this flavor - hark back to bubblegum of old.	1
Not a lot of stores carry this anymore. Love it!	1
Not at my Blood Bank!He was not scanning the horizon!	1
Not easy to find in the US, but it's a really good-tasting coffee.  I actually bought this to go with a fancy coffee press I got my husband for Valentine's Day -- he loved the gadget but I think he truly appreciated the Douwe Egberts as a real treat.	1
Not much to say other than I love Starbucks. Love their coffee and this is a good strong brew. I used it in my Keurig and it works great in the reusable KCup. All in all it is worth the price.	1
Not much to say, we all love gum. This is just a great deal. I get a shipment of this every six months	1
Not sure if I would like the 6 grain but my hesitation was for naught.  Love this cereal but the amounts had to be halved (directions) or we would be feeding four instead of two!  Tastes great and especially good on those cold mornings when oatmeal just seems bland.  Would buy again.	1
Not too much you can say about this.  A fun pack of sprinkles for the children to make their cupcakes and muffins.	1
Not used yet but I know that the product is good. Tried it before	1
Not worth making your own as this is the only seasoning my husband likes.  And let me tell you he loves it!	1
Note that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are complaints about sellers and shippers.  These delicious Belgian cookies are baked in Mississippi by DeBeukelaer, a company which traces its roots to 1860.  They are light, crisp, delicate and made with quality ingredients.  The dark chocolate are my favorite and the one I recommend to chocoholics.	1
NOTE:  These are ICING colors. While they will color fondant, and of course icing, they will not work for chocolate UNLESS you also buy this: It's Americolor Candy Oil and will stop the colorings from seizing up your chocolate!  https://www.amazon.com/Americolor-Candy-Oil-Flo-Coat-2-Ounce/dp/B00370BARM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1490816983&sr=8-1&keywords=AmeriColor+FloCoat  It's Americolor Candy Oil and will stop the colorings from seizing up your chocolate!	1
nothing special but had colors we were looking for and price was good.	1
Now I got the right packages of full bars. Thank you very much. Hopefully I'm not charged for a double order.	1
Now my Mechagodzilla cake can be finished properly...does it happen to come in amber as well for his eyes?? Oh not to worry I'll rig a couple lights and they will glow against his shimmery metal exterior...	1
Of all the various jerky cures and moxes, I've always returned to nesco for my spicey mix.  It has good body, and a delightful slow burn aftertaste any good jerky should have.	1
Of course this is a 5-star rating. They're sprinkles. Who doesn't love sprinkles?	1
Oh baby this is the BOMB - love jerky but need a little more zip?  Try out this flavor - I think you'll like it - one of my fav's!	1
Okay so I get all the joke reviews on here, but for those of you who are ACTUALLY looking to see if this product works, here's a real review! I purchased this to make silver throwing stars for my son's ninja birthday cake. I cut out the stars from black fondant and sprayed over them with the silver spray. It was very easy to use (I'm not a professional baker) and the end result looked pretty good!	1
Okay this is a great flavor. I have been experimenting with different additional spices. I will buy again	1
On time, exactly as advertised	1
On time, good price, great product!	1
Once again, very pleased with purchase and will purchase again in the future.	1
once i do my cupcake i change the color on top it going to look perfect and beautiful	1
Once you buy this you will be back for more. My grocery store carried this in the past so I got hooked. They no longer carry it but that is okay it's cheaper here.	1
One can of this spray goes a long way, and gives a metallic pearly shine to baked goods. Just have to remember to apply more or less pressure on the nozzle based on desired intensity of pearl color, and to hold the can a good 12 inches away from the spray location.	1
One can't go wrong with Wilton colors, although you have to be careful not to use too much as the colors are very intense!	1
One night my asthma was bothering me so I brewed a cup. Not crazy about the flavor but can overlook it since it works!	1
One of my favorite flavors!	1
One of my favorite seasonings since it's so versatile. Goes great with pizza and pasta, but it's basically my default Italian seasoning.	1
One of my warboys used this product three times and was not awaited in Valhalla. Buyers beware.	1
One of the best products I've ever used.  It's a time-saver because flour is included in the spray.  My cakes just pop right out of the pan.  Love it, love it and love it some more!	1
One of the best seasonings for pizza and other Italian dishes	1
one of the best spices on the planet and if do not have then you need to get this	1
One of the original nutrition bars.  Good flavor, not too sweet and definitely a good snack choice.	1
One of the recipes in my new cookbook can be adjusted to other flavors and colors and this product is exactly what I need for the coloring of the mints.	1
Only coffee I drink anymore. best flavor!!!	1
Only gum we chew, only buy on Amazon. Great price.	1
Only stuff I use for jerky . My whole family love it . I usually give it as gifts for birthday.	1
Orange sprinkles.  Exactly what they are.  Easy to use and they do sparkle !	1
Orbit gum is great! Sweetmint is my favorite, and the pack of 24 is plenty to keep me going for a long time.	1
Orbit is my favorite gum, and this is the best price available anywhere I have found.  I prefer sweet mint but this is good too.	1
ordered for my daughter to have jerkey on hand,  she travels oversea's for work and due to time zone changes, finds she is hungry when it is in the middle of the night whereever she is.  this way she can have a healthy protein rich snack to tide her over until she can find something open to get a meal.	1
Ordered this for my mother and she's really pleased. :)	1
Original Flavor is the very best for anyone who likes to make there own jerky.I haven't found anyone who did not like  the original	1
Original is our favorite but several others we have tried are good too. We use the extra lean ground beef with a jerky gun and 4-5 hours in our dehydrator! Delicious!!!	1
Original Seasoning made for you. You can add special flavors to it if you choose to : like sweeter or hotter or any flavor of your choosing, or just enjoy as it is.  Thank You.	1
Our favorite brand and flavor	1
Our favorite flavor! I've reordered & will continue to as long as we make jerky!!	1
Our favorite!!!	1
out of this world	1

Outstanding Jerky, so easy it almost makes itself.	1
Overall great, the spicey was the best!	1
Packed with Soooooooo much Flavor!!!	1
Paste unlike powder is the punch in a curry dish. This product offers great punch [heat], I would recommend it to any chef.	1
Perfect 1lb packages for those smaller needs met.  Great tasting. Maybe a bit to salty - but still yum yum.Will purchase again when I run out.	1
Perfect alternative to candied sugars and Royal Icing.	1
Perfect blend of season with a great favor	1
Perfect blend of seasonings for frozen pizza.  IF you wish to spice it up, just use red pepper flakes.  I don;t like their spicy version of this so I buy this one and add red pepper flakes when I want it a bit spicy.	1
perfect color	1
Perfect colors for decorating	1
Perfect find. Used for my cake pop and ice cream toppings for the kids. Accurate in description and great price. Thank You	1
Perfect for applying before leaping from war rigs onto pursuing vehicles and just about any situation that requires you to say your prayers beforehand. Retains its shininess, even in toxic sand storms. If you've gotta go, make sure you go shiny and chrome!	1
Perfect for authentic cafecito! It's bold without being bitter. Starting with whole beans makes a huge difference in the flavor.	1
Perfect for coloring icing.	1
Perfect for creative decoration of cakepops	1
Perfect for Darth Vader	1
Perfect for decorating Frozen themed cake.	1
perfect for making popcorn cupcakes!	1
perfect for making jerky	1
Perfect for making jerky. Use this stuff all the time.	1
Perfect for practice runs with the warpups back at the Citadel! They'll have no hesitation when it's time for them to ascend to Valhalla. They grow into warboys so fast...	1
Perfect for the cupcakes for a Hulk party.	1
Perfect for the Kitchen.. Showed up real fast..	1
Perfect gift for any Political numbskull who looses their way in the snowy blizzard of lies and deception in Washington DC.  This was the best gift I ever gave and would do it again! thanks Erik!	1
Perfect in every way!	1
Perfect orange color!	1
Perfect Sprinkle Assortment for the price & it comes in a nice little shaker. I'm pleased with this product & will order this exact assortment or a similar item again.	1
Perfect tasting jerky!	1
Perfect to take away my hunger when I don't have time to eat	1
Perfect!  I used it on marshmallows for popcorn themed cupcakes, and it worked perfectly! No taste. Great color.	1
Perfect. Just what I needed.	1
Pilon is as real as you can get to old style Cuban expresso.  Once you've tasted it, you will laugh at the Italian varieties, and defenetly at StarRipoffs (I mean StarBucks).One shot of this Rocket Fuel and you are set to conquer the world!	1
Pirate party for grandson, my daughter used this color mist on cookies to make it look like gold coins!  It was hit, everyone loved loved loved the novelty of it.	1
Pirouline Rolled Wafers: Gave as presents and all that received raved about them, I knew they would as I really liked the taste, texture and simpleness of such a good treat.	1
Piroulines arrived when promised and, as yet,  I haven't encountered any broken ones. Each rolled wafer is a perfect combination of textures: you encounter a crisp but not crumbly sheath of dough filled with creamy hazelnut chocolate. Piroulines are a perfect go-with any after dinner service: sorbets, ice creams, berries, gelato.	1
Pizza and Pasta Magic is a great seasoning, that makes almost everything taste better!!  I only wish that Chef Paul would sell it in local grocery stores.	1
Powerbar offers more and more variety to customers. The taste of this bar is delicious. As for the features, we all know the amount of energy provided by these products.	1
Powerbar Performance is the greatest for a quick snack or after a workout.	1
Pretty good Price	1
Pretty good, a little spicier than we expected	1
Price shipping and quality is great! Very bright colors	1

Product as described	1
Product as described! Fast shipping!	1
Product is easy to use and helps to create great jerky.....all ya gotta do is to add the meat (seasoned of course) and squeeze the trigger.  Works just like a caulking gun....only it sho0ts out future jerky!	1
Product tastes great and it's an excellent price. I will have gum now for a long time! With two of these I was able to give one away and still have the one for a great price.	1
Product works great.	1

PROs:NO MSG/Preservatives.Great flavor and heat.Easy to cook with.reasonably priced.CONs:-	1
Purchased as gifts for my son & daughter as well as our own household.  Great item and wonderful addition to our seasoning drawer!	1
Put the little flowers on some of the cup cakes, & on my cakes. I set them in the shell on the bottom border in between the shell border, with very tiny leaves. All loved them.	1
Quick delivery of product.  The product met my expectations!	1
Quick delivery, nice product	1
Quick shipping and just what I needed.  Made my Christmas wedding cake beautiful, giving it just the right touch!  Thanks!	1
Quite happy with this purchase.	1
Rainbow sprinkle cake  was a hit. Colors are true to photo.	1
Really adds to flavor of pizza without adding sodium.	1
Really awesome. I let it cook for 7 hrs, comes out perfect. Hot n spicy is my favorite so far. I add a tablespoon of seasoned pepper and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper for a little extra kick.	1
Really brightens up the flavor of both homemade and delivered pizza without a lot of heat. Even my kid loves it.	1
Really does help with congestion. Their Cold Care Teas are also great. They work and taste good as well.	1
Really easy and super tasty too. Can't keep enough around at work or home. Good stuff. We like it a lot.	1
Really good coffee but is costly.	1
Really good flavor and makes quite a bit of jerky.	1
Really good flavor.  Easy to make.	1
Really good green curry paste: we think it has a good balance of green curry elements.  Combine this with some coconut milk, add whatever else you want (garlic, ginger, nampla, kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass) and you are on your way. Great to add a nice Thai element to other dishes too.	1
Really good jerky	1
Really good seasoning. Everytime it comes out delicious.	1
Really good seasoning. Used exactly as instructed and cane out perfect. Amazing jerky! Will buy again when we run out.	1
Really good spices. Cheaper bought as a set.	1
Really good tasting flavors, I haven't even used all of them yet. For the best results marinate the hamburger over night.	1
Really great taste that stays  Really great deal.	1
Really help with my cough.	1
Really like it, will buy more in the future. A little cheaper at Micheals though. It colors really good and really don't need to use too much.	1
Really like these.  Will order again.	1
Really like this seasoning.  Not spicy or sweet, just a good flavor.  It can be a bit salty tasting.  Additionally, there's no wheat in this flavor so it's safe for gluten sensitive folks.	1
Really like this!!!	1
Really liked the flavor of this product. Has a sweet, smokey flavor that really works well with ground beef. Will be buying it again!	1
Really love this stuff, Works great everytime.	1
Really, really, REALLY good. Try placing a square of dark chocolate in the bottom of your cup and pour the coffee over it. It lasts the whole time you drink. Now, that's a Dutch experience.	1
Reasonable, not as spicy as Cracked pepper and garlic but tastes like regular beef jerky.  Good, but not out of this world.  Worth it though.  I like the process of integrating it in to the meat and then processing it in to strips and waiting for it to dry for 3 hours and having some hot beef jerky.  Yum.	1
Receive what was expected	1
Received on time and as described	1
Received product quickly.  It's everything promised.  We've used this product before.  It's great.	1
recommend to everyone-great taste=easy to do-mixes really well and dries just right not too soft and not too hard-love it	1
Red residue everywhere? Well of course you're supposed to decorate on top of wax paper or newspaper! I love all these color mists. They're so easy to use and give off a very nice look. For darker colors spray close, for lighter colors spray farther way. Be smart and decorate on top of your kitchen table using newspapers underneath :]	1
Repeat customer of product and enjoy it	1
RIDE ETERNAL, SHINY AND CHROME!!!	1
Ride silver faced into Valhalla!!	1
Robust full flavor, for the discriminating coffee drinker. Real coffee flavor for a decaf. I highly recommend it, as I do with all Starbucks products.	1
Rodelle Vanilla is now the only Vanilla I use in my cooking and baking. I have tried other brands but did not have the true Vanilla taste that Rodelle Vanilla has. I do recommend it to anyone who bakes a lot, it will make a difference in your cakes. Your family will thank you when you make the switch to Rodelle Vanilla.	1
Rodelle vanilla is really good quality vanilla, and one of the secrets to making excellent baked goods! I only use good quality pure vanilla extract in all my baked goods, and Rodelle is top notch! I love the pure vanilla smell that comes from their extract. That beautiful fragrance tells you that this is a great quality product. Do yourself and your family a favor and only use good quality vanilla, like Rodelle!	1
Rodent Rock Productions use and love Power Bars.  Since our roster of bands and musicians are on the road constantly, we stock the bars in the tour buss at all times.  We also expect the recording studios to provide Power Bars as well.  Taste great and much better than stuffing yourself with junk.	1
Ruling the tasteland just got easier!	1
Save it for a lovely day.	1
seasoning is great in taste! Also love that it comes in 1lb packages. I have purchased some seasoning that is just one big pouch and if you don't make all of it at once it gets stale. This keeps well.	1
Sent as a gift and they loved them!	1
Several years ago, I could buy this in my local supermarket.  I wanted a pepper sauce that was tasty but not painfully hot and happened on this one.  Chef Paul Prudhomme has come up with the perfect recipe to suit my taste.  It adds a marvelous taste to burritos and chile and sauces without going overboard.  I can't seem to find this sauce in a store any more and am grateful that I can buy it from Amazon.	1
She was excited to receive this sprinkles, her Mom and her make a lot of cupcakes/frosted cookies. I told them I wanted a chocolate cupcake with the cow sprinkles on it!	1
SHINY AND CHROME I RIDE ETERNAL. WITH THIS SPRAY I AM SURELY AWAITED IN VALHALLA.It kind of burns on your gums. In like a very intense Listerine kind of way. Not intolerable, probably better than that chrome spray paint you were considering using. It also works well for its intended purpose. I have used it on some cookies and they turned out quite nice.WITNESS ME!	1
Shiny and Chrome. This is what you need on your ride to Valhalla.	1
Shipped as stated.  Great service and best jerky mix on the market.  Easy to use and excellent flavor.  Highly recommend.	1
shipped quickly.  Item as described.	1
Shipping was fast.  Shamrocks held up. Not many broken. Great for St. Patrick's day party. Would purchase again. Wilton is a great choice.	1
simple and good	1
Smells really good. I like the flavor.Cons* Doesn't come in a bigger size  - I really don't understand why	1
So colorful! Will use all year round!	1
So convenient to buy it in bulk. Long-lasting flavor. My favorite gum.	1
so easy to use and yummy	1
So easy! Great coverage and beautiful outcome!	1
So far I've colored meringues, a cake, and buttercream icing.  The colors are solid - not at all wishy-washy.  You don't need to use too much though I wouldnt worry about applying with a toothpick as some writers suggest unless you are doing something very small or want a very specific shade.  I didn't try mixing them.  Very pleased with the results and the set of 6 gives a good range of color/shade options.	1
So fresh!!! Im a first time Rodelle brand user and totally fell in love. My cakes and cookies taste great. And love the plastic bottle 'cause i order international so i don't have to worry about a broken glass bottle. Will buy again.	1
so good	1
So good it makes your toes curl...	1
So much better than any other pre-made curry paste I've used before. With the addition of a few traditional ingredients, I'm able to make curries comparable to my favorite restaurant's. I also love how spicy it is!	1
So much better than the paste available in grocery stores.  Actually tastes like restaurant meals.  Yum	1
So perfect and easy at the office!	1
So shiney and chrome.	1
So shiny!	1
SO SHINY! SO CHROME! WITNESS MY SILVER GAPING MAW!	1
So shiny, much chrome!	1
So, will this make Jennifer Lawrence attracted to me as well?	1
Soft yet long lasting flavor.	1
Solid strawberry gum	1
Some of the best coffee I have ever brewed!	1
Some of the best jerky seasoning. Easy to use and inexpensive. All Nesco jerky equipment/products are great.	1
Something odd must have happened to Mr. Kelly.I have compared the espressione pods with those made by Illy, Starbucks, Saeco, and another I've forgotten, and the espressione pods produce the best espresso with the strongest taste of any.	1
Something to remember a special day.	1
Somewhat hot if you use as much as the directions suggest (you will need a magnifying glass to read the directions). Very good paste for curries.	1
Son who is a collegiate runner loves them and with Prime I am able to ship direct to his dorm.	1
soooo good on any meat recomended	1
Sooooo good.	1
Soothing yet strong...great!	1
Sorry I didn't take a pix of the cake I made. The red and blue were true to form , not baby pink and blue. I will never use the liquid food coloring again.	1
sparkes always a good choice...we use this every year when making our gingerbread houses as the sparkle in the snow!	1
Sparkly sparkles	1
SPECTACULAR.  I have purchased this multiple times now.  I have used many meats and vegetables in it too and have not been disappointed with any of them.  My favorite is simply chicken with red and green peppers and onions.  Many times I don't even bother cooking rice for it and just wipe out the pan by itself.  The Coconut milk brand WILL make a difference so make sure you use one that you would drink out of the can and not just cook with (like cooking with wine).	1
Spices are great	1
Sprayed small marshmallows on top of cup cakes to look like popcorn, was a big hit for my granddaughters birthday	1
Sprayed white fondant with this to make it look like a pot.  Used a few coats to achieve real silver but it was great.	1
Sprinkles for all occasions. Granddaughters enjoy using these on their cake pops. Nice assortment of sprinkles for various baking needs.	1
Starbucks coffee is always a treat.  However, I think that you can get a better price by watching for sales at your local supermarket.	1
Starbucks espresso is delicious and bold. ALWAYS consistent in quality and flavour.Don't forget to claim your Starbucks's points for making this purchase. The code is located on the sticker attached to the package 	1
Starbucks has a flavor all its own. This is a delicious Espresso blend.	1
Still have some when we like it.	1
Still working away on it.  I Love it.  Can't live w/o it.  Nice to have around when you need to eat, but you don't want the calories of a complete meal.	1
Subscribe and save and be saved!	1
Such a reliably delicious flavor. Order, order, order!	1
Such an unusual color for sugar. Thrilled to have found it and it is so high quality.	1
Such bright colors! Love them!	1
Such great flavors!! Our jerky came out delicious!!	1
Such shiny. Much chrome. Wow.	1
Sugar free, great taste, pretty long lasting.  Not a lot to say about gum.  I like it a lot.	1
Super concentrated.  Easy to use.  Love these.	1
Super cute--shipped fast!	1
Super delicious, and the price was better than the regular grocery store.	1
Super easy to use...easy to clean too! Works great, made perfect jerky strips. Highly recommend!!	1
Super Fast shipping! Everything as promised! A+	1
Super good price	1
super good, sugar free!	1
Super tasty!	1
Superior mint flavor that lasts a long time.	1
Sure you can make your own seasoning, as well as curing stuff, but who wants to spend time mixing seasoning and measuring out curing salt when you can just throw one of these packets in a bowl with a pound of ground beef and just mix it together. I've tried other flavors, mostly teriyaki, and it just doesn't come close to how good this stuff is!	1
Sweet and bubble gummy and not overly minty.  I keep a cup in the car all the time and it takes away my craving for sweets and freshens my breath without smelling like mouthwash.	1
Sweet hardwood is where it's at. I've tried most all of the flavors.	1
Sweet Mint!!! Yummmmy	1
Sweet with a bit of smoke. Not too salty (for a jerky). Not a lot of spices, so the flavour of the meat comes through really nice. I tried this with 90% fat free ground beef but will also try it with deer and elk. I would guess that this would be the perfect jerky season for deer or elk. Hmm ...Buffalo!?This seasoning is now one of my regulars (along with Original and Pepperoni (don't know why I can't find the Nesco pepperoni jerky seasoning on Amazon!!))	1
Sweet. Hard. Wood.	1
Switched over to the subscribe and save version. This is the flavoring I use for drained yogurt with fruit added:1 cup of yogurt, drained (leaves about a half cup)creampowdered coconut milk1/4 to 1/2 cup fruitsweetner of choice	1
Taatse great on all kinds of game meat , everyone loves my deer and beef jerky blah blah blah it's spices ...	1
Tal cual se muestra	1
Taste better than ground Pilon you buy in the grocery store.	1
Taste good for the venison jerky I made. Easy to use and follow directions.	1
Taste great going to get some more	1
Taste great!  This is made with a soy base protein.	1
Taste great! Just like they said it would!	1
Taste great, works great, will buy again.	1
Taste like blowloons when sprayed directly into the mouth but I feel forever shiny and awaited in Valhalla.	1
Taste like store bought.	1
Taste really good. I will buy it again	1
Taster Great!	1
Tastes and smells great! Sometimes the Strawberry flavor is hard to find but not on Amazon! One of the only flavors I chew. Love them!	1
Tastes good and is refreshing just like it supposed to . We love orbit gum and love this car case for it.	1
Tastes good and was cheap	1
tastes great - freshens breath	1
Tastes great and adds just what was missing to our homemade pizza!	1
Tastes great and can't be found at Costco.	1
Tastes Great!	1
Tastes great, chewy (maybe a little too chewy, sticks to the teeth) but if you just let them disolve in the mouth, they taste great and you don't have to get them off your teeth.	1
Tastes great, filling and lasts with you a long time. My daughter keeps one in her car when she doesn't have enough time between clients to eat a sit down lunch. I eat them to keep from eating a pint of ice cream as the bars are healthy and very satisfying. So glad we tried these.	1
Tastes Great, makes Great jerky.	1
Tastes great, no additives I can't live with, makes ordinary extraordinary. I put it in a glass bottle with a glass dropper for easier use in coffee and other beverages.	1
Tastes like Valhalla (gasoline)	1
Tasty and a good price	1
Tasty and fast delivery	1
tasty makes make's perfect jerky, I used elk meat and it came out great.	1
Tasty snack just before a workout. I have one of these before I ride bike. I ride for time and distance so I get a pretty good cardio workout and finish with some resistance and weight training. Easy to digest with two or three gulps of water. No discomfort during the workout. I've been using this product for several years and would recommend to others.	1
tasty turkey jerky!	1
Terrific seasoning kit. Very tasty and the instructions are very easy to follow.	1
thank you for evry things	1
Thank you for having a sense of humor!	1
thanks for the Wilton bake easy non stick spray, sure it will help keep my cakes from sticking thanks again have a nice day	1
The absolute best vanilla I have ever used.	1
The best	1
The Best Bars!	1
The best commercial seasoning I've found.	1
The best curry paste out there. A little dab will do you and it keeps in the fridge almost indefinitely.	1
The best drip coffee I have found.  I have been drinking it for several years now, even while straying off to try other brands.  I keep comming back to this for a smooth cup of morning warmth.	1
the best ever	1
The Best ever Coffee	1
The best for venison jerkey!	1
The best gum ever.  Hard to find in stores.	1
The best icing colors. The colors are so vibrant. Sometimes if I want to make breakfast a little fun for my daughter I'll take a tiny bit of an icing color and add it to my pancake mix.	1
The best jerky (a pound at a time) you can make. This is the best I have tried so far, this easy !!	1
The best jerky spice I have found!  Tastes great! Easy recipe!	1
The best Luna bar so far. They come as close to the girl scout cookies, Samoas. This bar is healthy and DELICIOUS! These two adjectives aren't usually used together when describing a health bar. I slightly heat this bar up in the microwave (at 10 seconds) and drink a glass of milk with this bar.	1
The best price you could ever get, Fresh made (not expired or not even close to expiry date), original neat whole pack that you couldn't buy from stores on this price. Orbit have had the best quality since beginning. Do not hesitate to get advantage of this great price deal of the best Sugar Free Gum.	1
The BEST seasoning ever!!!! If you haven't tried it, you need to now!!	1
The best seasoning for pizza ever. Nuff said	1
The best seasoning I have ever tried shame Walmart quite selling it	1
THE BEST SEASONING! EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK THE MEAL WILL BE DELISIOUS	1
The best spice I've tried to date.	1
The best standard goto	1
The best that I've found for making your own. Don't kill yourself trying to create your own seasoning. You'll never get anywhere near this close to perfection. They nailed it! It tastes awesome and everyone loves it! I add my own pepper to kick it up hot!	1
The best we ever found! Tried some other spice additives and some of them were o.k but Nesco mixes well and nothing else compares to the taste.	1
The blend of seasons in each jar was perfectly done. The all have a wonderful taste	1
The blue is an awesome color!	1
The bottle was bigger than I expected. It looks like white-out when you pour it. Works like a charm for whitening your frostings, sugarpaste, etc. Gets the job done!	1
The box was perfect for my brother in law who loves to cook.  He can't wait to try them out.	1
The bubblegum flavor is becoming hard to find locally. The material contained in the card board box was exactly as advertised on the Amazon .com web site. Everything OK	1
The color stays bright and there is no bad aftertaste. Just what I needed.	1
The coloring was very vivid.  Pleased!	1
The colors are beautiful and help me a lot in the preparation of sweets	1
The colors are intense and do not fade in daylight.  The drops are very thick, almost a gel.  It did not thin my frosting or impart any weird flavors.	1
The colors are perfect! Just what I wanted.  They arrived packaged well and on time.	1
The colors came out true to what the colors are on the box.  Used for coloring canned icing and worked great.	1
The colors didn't bleed in the icing. It added color and charm to some cupcakes that I wanted to look festive.	1
The colors were perfect and just enough to do what I needed. I was baking Christmas cookies and they arrived just in time.	1
The Cracked Pepper and Garlic and Original flavors are the best.  I bought the variety pack and used it for venison jerky.  I mixed the packs in water and used sliced meat instead of ground meat.The Hot and Spicy was extremely hot, more than I like.	1
The dark chocolate ones surpass all other flavors we've tried.  They're decadently delicious.  You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream.  Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price, given that shipping is free with Prime membership.  What a great deal!	1
The DeBeukelaer family has been making Belgium biscuits in The United States since 1860.Pirouline is the only national brand of rolled wafers actually made in America. One bite and you'll understand why these delicious and light snacks can be very addicting.The biscuit layer is light and flaky and the hazelnut chocolate inside makes for delicious snacking.They come in a tall, slender, 3.25 ounce tin and the tins are great for storing pasta or writing instruments afterwords. Highly recommended.	1
The decaf coffee is really great.  I would order it again.  I would recommend it highly.	1
The flavor and chew-ability of this product is superior.  I think it is the little kid/bubblegum feeling!  I chew this for dessert at least four times a day to help with my sugar cravings.  I have recommended it and have given samples to everyone I know.	1
The flavor is just okay, but it helps with occasional breathing issues... so I love it!  I mix it with Tazo's sweet orange (which is kind of sour, not sweet)  and the two together results in a very smooth, rich and flavorful tea.	1
The flavor is powerful and seems to last!	1
The flavor of this gum is so good that I always buy it from Amazon in bulk!!  I've been buying this from Amazon for the last 3 years and I still love the flavor!	1
The flavor of this is amazing.  We will definitely be purchasing this on a regular basis and giving the jerky as gifts.  Everyone just loves the flavor.	1
The food coloring arrived and performed as expected. I do resent the requirements to make comments for the product. Just want to purchase what I want and then be left alone!!!	1
The gum is what it is...the key is the price! The price becomes reasonably close to a Sam's or Cosco only when you subscribe to their automatic shipment program. I needed to make it semi-annual to work for me, get my usage to align with cost.	1
The gum was packaged in a large box, which I found a bit unnecessary. However, I was otherwise pleased with this product. The gum was easy to open, and tastes great! It lasts pretty long too, compared to other brands.	1
The Iced Oatmeal/Raisin LUNA bars are my favorite!  They remind me of cookies of the same name but I know I am getting good-for-me ingredients.	1
The item arrived fast and as advertised.	1
The jerky made with this flavor was DELICIOUS! I cannot wait to make another batch. Will not hesitate buying from in the future.	1
the jerky mix seems to be way to salty. Never remember it being that way. Was their something wrong with the batch.	1
The jerky spice was great. It tasted so good with my deer jerky. I chose this because it's my favorite flavor i really don't like any otherflavors other than original.	1
The kids loved these! Monitor children when they are using these, as they will find a way to shake out all $7 worth of sprinkles in less than one minute.	1
the Mae Ploy line of Curry Pastes are one of the most authentic tasting curry pastes out there.  i highly recommend for those of us who like and know authentic Thai foods but just don't have time or inclination to make our own spice mixes.	1
The mix is easy to use and tastes great.  I expect to order this again.	1
The Nesco American Harvest Jerky Works has made jerky preparation a snap! The homemade jerky is comparable to the jerky sticks you can purchase in stores. The process is simple ground meat of your choice, spice and cure. Load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round. Dependent upon your food dehydrator you can have jerky in a matter of hours. Replacement spices and cures can be found at most larger department/retail  stores. Thanks Amazon.com for recommending this product!	1
The Nesco Teriyaki flavor was the first spice packets that I've used and I love them. They've also been a big hit with everyone that has tried my jerky. Much more so than any other flavor. 5 stars for cheap, easy, and delicious.	1
The only available items for this product in the stores in my area are all for colors.  I needed to get the pearl which mainly leaves a nice pearlescent sheen on the fondant (or frosting)it looks great and was shipped promptly.	1
The only bars my husband will eat!!!	1
The only gum I chew.  It is, what it is.  What can you say about gum.	1
The only gum that I willingly chew is this strawberry flavored Orbit. It just gives a sweet taste afterwards and a sweet scent in my mouth all day long.	1
The only jerky seasoning I use, and have been for almost 10 years.	1
The only non-Rx remedy that works for me (and I've tried them all!)	1
The only reason I bought this is because I wanted a large amount for a good price. Exactly what you'd find at a store. The flavor lasts for a decent amount of time (it's gum, it's not meant to be chewed forever). What I like about this flavor is that is a nice sweet mint, compared to the strong peppermint taste of other gum(s) (not that it's bad).	1
The only thing that taste better than the wild berry energy bars are the tropical tangy bars. This is a great PowerBar series.	1
The only way to wake up.	1
The Orbit bubblemint sugarfree gum is a nice small container that can fit in just about all situations and provide you with plenty of gum to last for a while. The gum itself comes in the usual small rectangular shapes and typically I found lasted about an hour or so of constant chewing. For the price and amount of gum you really can't go wrong if you like bubblemint flavor.5 Tasty Stars out of 5!	1
The order was accurate and arrived sooner than expected.	1
The original flavor is the best. I use slightly less than they recommend when I make beef jerky. I guess it depends on your preferences though. Great flavor though.	1
The original is the best.	1
The package, a 5-pound bag of rock salt, was delivered promptly and received in good order. I am looking forward to using it to make home-made ice cream for a family reunion which will be attended by over fifty relatives in July. From my experience, Grady's Hardware treats their customers very well.	1
The packaging was good and arrival time was earlier than expected.  The colors are bright and fun and the sprinkles were fresh and not stale like some can be.  They made my Christmas cookies extra special.	1
The perfect pizza spice	1
The picture was very clear and I liked very much the manufacture also, I received the part on time without any problem. Thanks for the job let's keep working like this satisfying correctly the customer.	1
The pink sparkles werea great touch to the cake & cupcakes. Very nice	1
The Power bars arrived fresh and popped cleanly out of the wrappers. As for the taste, that's subjective - I have always liked them.	1
The price was right and I like all original NOT the variety pack	1
The product arrived on time as promised.  The bars tasted very good.  I am saticfied with this purchase.	1
the product is at great price fast service	1
The product is excellent and it arrived on time!  Thank you Artist Donnis Crowe	1
The product is getting more expensive and harder to get.  The manufacturer seems to be adding flavors frequently but the new ones don't come close to Fudge Graham.  Hope they keep them on the market and don't change the recipe.  Note that anything with CORN SYRUP is not good for you.	1
The product is great, but it was not as advertised.  It showed 6 bottles and in the shipping weight it was for 6 bottles, but when it arrived there was only 1 bottle.  So therefore I gave it 5 stars because I liked the product, but only because of that.	1
The recipient loves them. Apparently better than the milk chocolate ones. Too bad they don't come in the larger tins at a reasonable price.	1
The seasonings are always good and fresh.  We order every year about this time of year to make beef and venison jerky for Christmas gifts.	1
The smell is great!. Not sure if it helped me with my snoring, but it definitely clears congestion. Tastes good too! Worth the money...	1
The spices add alot of flavor to all the food we have tried it on.  Will order them again.	1
The spices are just perfect for the jerky that I make	1
The spices really make my foods taste great - especially the blackened seasoning.  I use it on steak and shrimp - - our favorite!	1
The spray does a wonderful job of applying chrome to my mouth and cheeks. Much better than the pictures provide. This will be great for when its my time to be witnessed. Well worth the money.	1
The sweet hardwood is delicious! Almost like a bologna flavor. I used it for ground venison out of the jerky blaster. Best tasting homemade venison jerky I've made yet. It took 6 hours in the dehydrator.	1
The taste was good, the procing was also reasonable, and the shipping was satisfied as well.It was even better off to buy it online than buying it offline.	1
The teriyaki seasoning gives the jerkey a hearty spicy, yet sweet flavor.	1
The very best combinations of seasonings for Jerky that I have found. I have tried them all I think.	1
The Wastelanders are all over this!  https://youtu.be/LXWDXLPYNaU?t=1m11s	1
Their a bit smaller in diameter than I remember,  but so are candy bars... the taste is satisfying and only one carton remains in the pantry.	1
There are no instructions for use included on the packaging.	1
There whoppers, cant mess that up.	1
There's nothing like Starbucks for a morning pick me up. The very best. An excellent value. Highly recommend the product.	1
These actually taste good. I was surprised.	1
These also, send me more	1
These are a great way to eat Dr. recommended dark chocolate.  The wafer is light, crisp and lets the chocolate flavor shine. And they stay fresh and whole in the tins.	1
These are a terrific way to get fibre and protein into your body in a way that tastes really good.  It really does seem like you are eating a dessert rather than a nutrition bar. And doing it through the automatic shipments saves me time and lots of money!	1
These are AMAZING!!! Rich dark chocolate, thin wafer crust. I just love them and so does the wife. Almost an addiction by now :).	1
These are available in sealed tins in different sizes.  They are sometimes available in stores, but the Amazon price, per ounce, is somewhat lower than what I have found in stores.  The ones I have purchased have internal foil wraps for added protection.  They can be somewhat fragile if mishandled (that may depend on your local shipper).  They are suitable for serving with coffee or tea for various social events.  The tines have a best buy date shown on the bottom of the tin.	1
These are delicious and a great price. They're my goto meal on the grab and go or post work out. Sugar content is a little higher than I expected but I will forfeit my dessert and eat this sometimes in replacement of it.	1
These are delicious and definitely one of the better all-around tasting protein bars Ive had in a long time. Will be getting more soon.	1
These are delicious and filling. They are the perfect meal replacement on the busy city girl's go! Highly red foment!	1
These are delicious supplemental nutrition bars that are easy to digest.  The taste is reminiscent of a Thin Mint cookie, and the peppermint makes them refreshing.  I will definitely buy these again. Buying them on Amazon is a huge savings as well!	1
These are delicious!  My wife and I both incorporate them into our daily diet and they are both satisfying and nutritious.  When you can catch them at $24.99 a package that's only a little over $1.00 per bar.	1
These are delicious, absolutely impossible to resist.  They never made it to the party they were intended for. I had to buy more. Good Price for an excellent treat.	1
These are delicious.  We used them for a graduation party and tied red ribbons on the ones that were not broken.  They do break easily but I think that is to be expected.  They were a big hit at the party!	1
These are delicious. I eat them for breakfast on the run. Highly recommended.	1
These are fantastic. I use them for everything from making water colors to making whitener from my teeth. Dying eggs. They do it all.	1
These are good energy bars.  They work well to hold off the need for a meal for a few hours.  They taste fairly well too,  but they do have a bit of a soy taste to them.  Peppermint is fun however,  appropriate for the holiday season which is coming up soon.  I recommend these if you don't mind a soy taste.	1
These are great	1
These are great and love all the colors!! Love Wilton products!!	1
These are great tasting bars with a pretty good nutrition profile. I love the fudge graham, my husband loves the peanut butter, so this is the perfect back for us.	1
These are great to add a little sparkle to your dessert without being too much.  Love the way they take it to the next level and make you look like a pro.  Doesn't affect the taste at all by the way.  You will love!	1
these are great to use for chocolate melting, and coloring	1
These are great.	1
These are great. Cute and cheap.	1
These are much better than the colors they sell in the grocery store.  More vivd	1
These are must haves for the kitchen. Tangy, easy to use. No salt or other spices needed when you use this product.	1
These are my favorite Power Bars! I take them with me when I have an early appointment or tee time.	1
These are my first gel food colors.  They worked really beautifully to color the rainbow layer cake that I made my daughter for her birthday.  Says these are for icing, but worked well on cake mixture.  Vibrant and easy to use.	1
These are NOT sweet at all, which I like.	1
These are perfect for St. Patrick's day! I made green velvet cupcakes topped with these shamrock-shaped sprinkles for work and everyone loved them. Please note, however, that there are more white sprinkles in this mix than the shamrock-shaped green ones. I didn't mind this as I thought it made my cupcakes look more classy, but these sprinkles may not be for you if you're looking for more green color on your cupcakes.	1
These are pretty awesome!	1
These are probably the best flavor for power bars. Not only do I love them, but my kids do as well. My kids can only have them if they are doing exercise training that day. I ordered two boxes, they were delivered quickly and I couldn't tell any difference than had I had bought them from the store. I am ready to order more and will use the same seller if they have these.	1
These are really cute sprinkles.  Will be cute on whatever you put them on.	1
These are really great pods. It tastes way better than starbucks, and the price is really good!!!!!!	1
These are really great, vibrant food colors! Love them! A little bit goes a long way with these.	1
These are small but mighty gels.	1
These are small tubs but you don't need much because the gel is so think. One dip of a small spoon and you have enough to color an entire cake! Easy to store because of there small size and no bad after taste.	1
These are so delicious oh my god. These are a delicacy at our household. Absolutely amazing.A lot of them did home split in half. But they're so good we didn't mind.Overall amazing treat! Great with morning coffee or tea!	1
These are so much better than the food coloring you would buy out of the grocery store. You only need a little coloring to achieve your desired color.	1
These are so potent and a little goes a long way!	1
These are so tasty. What a great bargain!	1
These are some of my favorites. We like to munch of these while we watch movies on television. I bought some recently to use in a cookie recipe that sounded delicious but I waited too long to start baking. Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter. I was mad but as usual I got over it. I will try that recipe some other time. Whoppers are just too good to be left alone for any length of time at my house. They don't hang around very long at all.	1
These are tasty protein bars.  The texture is not gritty like a lot of protein bars. They are satisfying with no after taste.	1
These are the talk of the town.  Everyone says this is the best jerky ever.  Very pleased.	1
These are the BEST blended seasonings I've ever used. The added flavor is wonderful and provides and additional kick to meats and veggies.	1
These are the best colors for coloring frosting. I've used Wilton brand for years and always get consistent colors. A little goes a long way (unless your want red, then you need a lot of dye).	1
These are the best cookies of this kind I have had. I got Trader Joe's like these and these are cheaper per cookie and much better tasting.	1
These are the best little snacks for an energy boost on a hike, during the work day or on a road trip. Love 'em to death!	1
These are the first food colouring items I've ever bought and I'm really happy with them.  I used them in sugar cookies and the colours were vibrant and well-defined (http://bit.ly/11dJqL5).  I only used a few drops to achieve the colour I wanted and it mixed well with the dough.  The colour added no taste whatsoever to the cookies which is exactly what I expect from food colouring.  I'd definitely recommend this product to others.	1
These are the only flavor I eat, I've been eating these since I was a kid, I'm 21 now. I only like this flavor. So I was so happy when I could buy them in bulk.	1
These are the original style of the powerbars.  For some reason not many retailers stock this brand.  Tasty, filling and affordable.  Great for a lunch or snack on the run or when traveling.  When you buy them in bulk they are much less than in the store, when, as I said above, you can find them.	1
These are the very first gel coloring i have bought,  but so far i love them!  The red takes a lot to make it actually red,  but I have heard that is common with any red. The coloring did not change the taste of my cake or icing which is awesome. I used the food coloring for this cake and the rainbow on it. They turned out nice.	1
these are yummy, yummy, yummy.	1
These balls are great tasting candy. The aftertaste is great as well. These chocolate balls are tasting. Fully recommended. Five stars.	1
these balls of chocolate have a malted milk center.  the taste is pleasant.	1
These bars are amazing.  High protein and a great taste.  Highly recommend!!	1
These bars are awesome as a meal replacement (or a snack depending on your hunger!).  These are my two favorite flavors.  Unlike many other protein bars, these do not taste chalky at all.  The flavors are delicious!  I highly recommend trying them.  You will not be disappointed!	1
These bars are great tasting and very filling. Not small like many bars. And only 3 WW points. I love them.	1
These bars are wonderful and I am so glad to have found them on Amazon!! Thank You.	1
These bars arrived as promised. They were fresh and tasty. The price was reasonable.	1
These bars have a good taste, maybe a small after taste.  Believe the after taste is because these bars have so many nutrients in them compared to any other bar.  Also these bars are much cheaper than any other bar I've found (< $1/bar).  They have more calories than same, but they are also a bigger bar.	1
These bars really give me the extra energy I need before my workout and they taste good too!! Will definitely order again.	1
these boxes are very handy to have especially at work.  No refridgeration needed.	1
These color sprays are the best.  I use them all the time for cupcakes for my kids school stuff.  They are always a big hit.	1

these colors are amazing	1
These colors are awesome and the gel works so good. I have only used gel once before and I was so shocked at how much better the gel is than the liquid.	1
These colors are bold and bright!  They are very high quality and work very well when making hard candy! I would recommend these.	1
These colors are bright and beautiful.	1
These colors are great, I usually just have to use a tiny dab, the red isn't very red, but they never really are, I definitely would buy again	1
These colors are really pretty! I only used one of them so far (Christmas red) and I loved it. The only thing I wish was different is the green, I wish it was darker, but I can mix it with some blue. Can't wait to try the others!	1
These colors are so easy to use.  They are not super liquid like other food coloring so they don't get all over the place when you use them.  Colors are vibrant and I highly recommend.	1
These colors rang very true, as Wilton colors always do. I have found that the easiest way to avoid using the whole container of black on one batch of frosting is to make chocolate frosting and then tint black.	1
These colors work great.  Wilton has the best color selection and this combination of colors were wonderful. They also last forever!	1
These colors worked well when I was tinting fondant I was making. The colors were deep and it did not take much of the coloring to make the perfect shade of tiffany blue for the wedding cake. I also used the colors as paint on the white flowers I made so they looked like mock orange blossoms. I'd buy this again in a new york minute!!	1
These creamers are ideal to have in an office for coffee first thing in the morning. The box is perforated and sturdy so it is easy to open and the creamers come out without a hassle. The plastic  covers on the creamers pull off with little difficulty.I highly recommend these creamers for the office and those who like French Vanilla flavor and are lactose intolerant.	1
These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts. I have used them to make finger paint, paint, play dough, and salt dough.Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT. They are definitely artificial dyes. I tried making my own dyes, and when that fell through, these worked great in a pinch. You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color. And they are pretty easy to clean - don't stain after they've been made into whatever craft.Good product for the price!	1
These figurines are timeless and beautiful.	1
These flakes of shimmering sugar candy are fantastic!!!! They give elegance to any cake!  I though them on after cake is finished and looks fantastic!!!!! I always keep them on hand!	1
These gel colors are amazing bright. I have used them in desserts while my daughter uses them in DIY experiments. Great as always, Wilton!	1
These individual cups are perfect for the office.  They don't need to be refrigerated and they make keeping the break/coffee area clean easier.	1
These just make frosted cupcakes look so darn yummy! Can't wait to mix up a batch and add the sprinkles.	1
These make the icing perfect colors and the item was received quickly too!	1
These mixes make the best burger jurkey	1
These organic energy little gummy sharks are amazing. Also hard to find commercially. Sometimes I can find them at Whole Foods, but it is easier to buy them in bulk as you can't count on them being in stock. Great for runners or any sports minded people, on hikes, walks, etc... it's chewy electrolytes in the form of a gummy shark!	1
These particular power bars are very hard to find in my area of the country.  I like the flavor of these power bars over the  many kinds of power bars that contain mainly chocolate.	1
These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.Fresh ground coffee is nice, but there is virtually no mess with these pods. The crema is just as good as ground coffee & these can be used in a pod holder as well as a one cup filter basket.What more could a person want?!	1
These Power Bars are the best. They are delicious and filling and keep you going out on the bike. Beware the bars freeze when you are riding in freezing temperatures and you can't bite into them, but worth the wait when they warm up. Amazon offers excellent service and fast shipping as always. Enjoy!	1
These PowerBar Fruit Smoothie Energy Bars have a great flavor.  My husband likes in his lunch or for his triathlon training.	1
These protein bars are absolutely the best product.	1
These reviews are histarical!!!!!!!!	1
These seasonings are great. I think they're a bit pricey. The reason I make jerky is to save on costs. Paying an extra $1/lb just for seasoning isn't my thing. I won't by these again and will just mix up my own seasoning.	1
These seasonings are wonderful! This pack of blends works perfectly to spice up any meat, seafood, or vegetable! We absolutely love it! :)	1
These spice mixes are GREAT. They last a long time and definitely provide some nice flavor to the dish of your choice. Tried the multipack to see what some of the other spice mixes were like and wasn't disappointed.	1
These spices are excellent the flavor is fantastic	1
These spices are great. A little pricey but worth the money. Just enough flavor	1
These spices are great. We are sold on this line now. I never thought I would say that as a foodie, but each spice is perfectly paired with its intended food.	1
These spices made great jerky!	1
These spices remain my favorites. While I do use individual spices in many recipes, most dishes I cook are just as good with these prepared/mixed spices! When I use these, I receive compliments on my cooking.I requested them at three different grocery chains in my area and was told that the spices were only available at Christmas time which is really quite a strange reply and not true as they can be ordered year around.I thank Amazon for making them available!	1
These sprinkles are great, they add a nice touch to a variety of desserts for the 4th of July and more. The vendor shipping was faster than expected and the price was good.	1
These sprinkles are such a variety of fun shapes. We have ice cream or cake and whipped cream for dessert and just pass the sprinkle container around. Everyone picks their topping. The taste is not great. They are cornstarchy, but it isn't important in this application.	1
These sprinkles provided great variety for my cupcakes of different varieties. This was a really great buy for those who want to decorate with a little style	1
These taste great	1
These tasted great and have plenty of protein. Great breakfast  on the go or snack. Healthier thank the traditional corn syrupy granola bar	1
These tasty lemon drops are saving my teeth. I have a dry mouth and because of that was getting cavities frequently. My dentist wanted to do a cleaning every 3 months. I suddenly realized after using these good tasting drops with excellent ingredients I haven't gotten cavities in 2 years. I'm so grateful for this great product that is composed of healthy ingredients. It's also saving me money.	1
These things are hard to find in stores, so thank you Amazon for selling them.  They taste like oatmeal in a bar without any of the extras.  Great taste and nice boost of energy before my workout i.	1
These wafers are incredibly delicious!  Amazon sells them by the case, and I order them to have for gifts.  Everyone who has tasted them raves about them--even if they say they don't like dark chocolate.	1
These wafers are soooo good. They are crisp and filled with chocolate. They make a dessert by themselves and are especially good with a cup of flavored coffee.	1
These were colorful, cute, very Irish, and provided the finishing touch to  our St. Patrick's Day baking session.  The cuts are well defined.  I will order again next year.	1
These were great for decorating the cake pops but the candy melts that should have been used were terrible but yes the sprinkle assortments were great	1
these were great.  they made a Marine platoon very happy for extra energy before their personal fitness and platoon fitness ad combat training.	1
These were great.  would recommendhad to do 450 cupcakes and these were the icing on the caketry em you will love them..	1
These were shipped fast! I love the graham taste. Very good bars! Very filling.	1
These were the colors that didn't fall to the bottom of our oil based lip balms.	1
These work great!! We used for colored pancakes. Colors looked awesome.	1
These work perfect to color white icing for my cake balls. However, don't store these bottles on their side; it will leak!	1
These work very well and are quite handy. I especially love the vegetable one.	1
These works very well as getting the colors exactly how they are supposed to look as opposed to tons of food coloring ruining my frosting with all the liquid.	1
Thesr are great, I enjoy having one after a meal.  It's my new desert!	1
They are my absolute favorites. I get them on auto delivery so I never run out. My 15 year old granddaughter loves them too.	1
they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting...just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all...	1
they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting...just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all...	1
They are sprinkles, so what could be bad about them?	1
They don't make this flavor anymore :(	1
They don't sell these in any of my local stores anymore and they are essential to the gingerbread men I make every winter. I was so happy to find them here online and even more pleased that they were able to be shipped to me within 2 days (just in time for my holiday work party)	1
They looked awesome on the cake I decorated for a graduation.	1
They made my black as night candy apples look awesome  - leaves mouth black though, which is funny if you don't tell people, haha	1
They work pretty well.	1
They work well and are concentrated. I used 1 drop to tint 5 oz. of white chocolate a pink color.	1
They're frickin Whoppers! My teeth ache sometimes, but I gotta have one more!	1
They're great to have in my purse while doing errands.	1
They're great!!	1
They're the best	1
Think big red when you order this gum.  Did you grow up chewing big red and remember people or kisses related to it?  If so you will welcome the smell and tingly of this cinnamon gum.  I will probably order this again from amazon sooner than the 6 months I set it to subscribe.  Tasty and when you open the pack the whole car smells warm and cinnamonly	1
This a great product.  I love the grainy and nugget taste of the cereal.What I really appreciate about this cereal is that it is organic and full of good stuff.My regular store that carries organic foods has stopped carrying it, which I feel is a real mistake.I would happily recommend this to all my friends.	1
This amazing product miraculously combines sodium and chorine into a stable mineral compound.  Then when combined with ice, it accelerates the melting of the ice.  That reaction requires heat, which it draws from the surrounding area.  The result?  A mixture of dairy products, fruit and sugar in an adjacent container becomes ice cream.  There is a glacier near my house that's really been bothering me, and I'm going to pour some of this sodium chloride on it to see what happens.  Wish me luck.	1
This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors.  Colors are  vibrant, and do not taint the frosting like some colors can.  These are  simple to use, and do not make a mess.  My only complaint is that I did not  find these years ago.  This is a must have if you decorate often!	1
This bar is SO good.  The raisins are plump and soft, the texture is pleasantly chewy.  The cookie, I mean bar,  has a wonderful cinnamon taste and there is no weird aftertaste.  It is so much like a 'real' oatmeal cookie, you'll want a glass of ice cold milk with it.  I will be eating these for breakfast on the run, afternoon snack, or even dessert.	1
This beautiful Lenox piece was my wedding cake topper.  It is quite beautiful and everyone loved it!  I'm glad that I have such a wonderful keepsake of my wedding day!	1
This bottle is a steal, at Whole Foods (at least where I live) a bottle half this size costs twice as much. Before I was also using imitation vanilla, it smells okay but you can smell the fillers. This bottle smells like fresh, pure vanilla. I used it in a lemon poppy seed cake and it was delicious, mild and aromatic! My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL!	1
This brand has the most variety of flavors i have used yet. i use a jerky gun made by the same company. There is a flavor for everyone in the family. I prefer mine hot n spicy but the maple bacon is to die for. i would recommend this brand for any jerky lover <3	1
This brand is mellow and smooth.  No acidic, stomach assaulting bite, like many coffees.  If you don't like to be abused by your beverages, Egberts is good stuff.	1
This Cake topper is very elegant and a wonderful keepsake. The detail is remarkable and the pictures do not do it justice!  Although it is a bit pricey...I recommend this cake topper for anyone who is looking for something that is elegant and a lifetime keepsake.	1
This cake topper was beautiful at my daughter's wedding.  It could not be placed on top of the cake because it was a little to heavy but it was placed in front of the cake.  It still looked beautiful and she now has something to place in her china closet to remember their special day.	1
This cake topper was exactly what we wanted... classic bone china, without painted on colors, etc.  We received many positive comments about how classy it was on our cake table.  The price on amazon was about 30% less than buying it at a brick and mortar store.	1
This cereal disappears in our house-- burly men, dainty, figure-watching women, and children all approve of this hot cereal. Nice, grainy texture. Perfection with a bit of brown sugar and milk. And don't even get me started on the muffin recipe on the back of the bag.... Simply delicious!	1
This cereal is 5 stars!  Nutritious, sustaining food for breakfast, snack or anytime!  Cook with other hot cereal, great with fruit!  All positives!  Can't say enough good things about it!	1
This coffee is a fantastic, smooth coffee. Not as good as Douwe Egberts in a resturant good (can't figure that one out though), but fantastic.	1
This coffee is the best!!!	1
This coffee smells and tastes delicious.	1
This color was great for Easter sweets. It's amazing how easy you can decorate the cake with always outstanding result!	1
This coloring works well with chocolate bark which will seize with water based colorings. My problem with this is the size these are skimpy little containers so this is a one batch deal.	1
This container really keeps my beans fresh. Just keep it in a cool dry, dark place and enjoy fresh coffee!	1
This continues to be the flavor of choice for our family. Every order we have received has been fresh and well packed. When compared to the price you would pay at your local retail store for a 3 pack, you are crazy not to buy it here!	1
This curry paste is very spicy!  But once you're past the first couple of bites, it's very tasty.  I love it!	1
This curry paste makes a delicious curry.  I just fried up some chicken and vegetables and added coconut milk to this for a delicious dish.  Quite spicy, so if you're looking for something mild, look elsewhere	1
This doesn't even work I'm very disappointed and hope that the manufacturer knows that it is unethical to sell something that doesn't even work	1
This expresso is easy to use and tasty, and virtually as good as fresh ground without the trouble.  I recommend to anyone.	1
This flavor is hard to find so I was happy to find it on-line.  Great for extra energy before or after a workout	1
This food coloring was great, a thick gel that made my icing a very deep blue and red.	1
This frosting is very sweet and rich but it's perfect for the taste we were looking for to make a lightning mcqueen cake!	1
This gives everything you put it on that smoked bar-b-q flavor.It does have a little bit of a bite, but it is delicious.	1
This gold mist is great! I used it to decorate gold bricks I made out of cake for my nephew's pirate birthday party. It was really easy to apply and looked great. It has a nice shimmer to it too.	1
This great tasting and super easy to use.	1
This green curry paste is authentic, delicious, fresh, and EASY to use. I am going to keep it a pantry staple. It's one of my favorite dishes when I go to eat out - and now I can make it any old time at home. I was surprised at how good it is!	1
This green curry pasty is absolutely delicious! It definitely blows other curry pastes out of the water, despite not being available in a local grocery store. The heat and the flavor offered over the TK curry is amazing!	1
This gum arrived fresh, well packed, and ready to chew.  Much better price than the local retailer and I won't run out for a long while.  Nom nom nom	1
This gum is delicious.  Instead of paying $1.50 per pack at the local newsstand I can buy these bricks and they last for months.  Like the commercial says, it's Fabulous.	1
This gum is my favorite and none of the stores near me carry it any more.  Thanks a million.	1
This gum is tasty and a great deal!	1
This gum tastes like the gum I chewed when I was a kid, without all the sugar.  Hard to blow bubbles with, but that's expected with Orbit gum. Getting too old to blow bubbles anyways	1
This gun takes all the trouble out of making beef jerky and the process is very smooth.  An excellent product, and very easy to use and clean.	1
This has a mild flavor which is great for basic jerky.  But it also works great as a starting point if you want to add your own additional spices.  We like to add either a teaspoon of cajun seasoning or, for a spicier jerky, 1/2 teaspoon jalapeno powder + 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper.	1
This has become a regular drink for me, sometimes daily. It helps whenever I feel sinus problems coming, chest congestion, and issues from vog here in Hawaii. This along with my Neti pot help a lot.	1
This has become my single spice of choice for about 80% of my barbecue dry rubs. When I still want to add my own flavor profile this starts as the base. For years the Meat Magic was the base but now, for barbecuing I found the Magic...This Paul Prudhommes seasoning blend, like all others in the line of Magic seasoning exceeds expectations.	1
This has been my favorite gum for years. Happy to purchase in bulk at Amazon!	1
This has been my favorite over the counter seasoning. Although now I just buy the original now and just spice it up how ever I won't it.	1
This has been my favorite over the counter seasoning. Although now I just buy the original now and just spice it up how ever I won't it.	1
This helps my asthma sooooooooo much. It's the one thing that will calm it down and not make me tired. In fact because it relieves my symptoms I end up with more energy. There's always a good supply at home and at my office!	1
this i the only one i use, guest love the flavor.	1
This icing is not meant for spreading over a whole cake. It's very stiff icing for making flowers and other decorations. The icing that comes in the 4.5lb tub is for covering the cake. I recommend not buying from Amazon though. The same product is half that price at WalMart. They put it back with the wedding stuff and crafts. You can also get it cheaper at Hobby Lobby, Michael's, etc.	1
This idea the only Jerkey spice I use. Turns out great every time.	1
This is a bit stronger tasting than DE's classic blend but is just as enjoyable. I loved it and highly recommend this brand.	1
this is a delicious espresso blend and the price is goodthere is a good crema and the pods work in every ESE machine	1
This is a great BBQ Rub.  We have used it ever since being introduced to it when visiting Louisiana.  Adds great flavor to barbecued steak.	1
This is a great but on subscribe and save and pmuch cheaper than I can find in the store.  Flavor doesn't last that long but it is great while it does.  I keep the entire desk on my desk at work and take a pack when I go to meetings and leave on the table for the group.  It is usually gone by the end of the meeting.	1
This is a great deal for the money.	1
This is a great deal!  My favorite flavor Luna Bars is Chocolate Mint.  Having them sent with the automatic delivery is great because I always have them on hand and pay the best price anywhere.  The no shipping charge is an added bonus.	1
This is a great lubricant. Bread and cakes slip out easily	1
This is a great price for gum.	1
This is a great product with two different tips to do different size jerky.  I used the smaller tip for jerky this year and it came out great	1
This is a great product, very good for hamburger beef jerky	1
This is a great quality product and Amazon often saves me on the price.	1
This is a great set with very clean, concentrated colors. Highly recommended. You don't have to add a ton of product to bring out the color and it doesn't 'water down' your recipe!	1
This is a great spice and will buy again	1
This is a great substitute for sweet cravings!  It tastes awesome, without the guilt!  The best flavored chewing gum ever!	1
This is a great tasting coating for jerky & is easy to use	1
This is a great way to try all of the flavors that Nesco offers without purchasing extra that you may or may not like. I fully recommend this to anyone who will be making jerky. Personally I found I really liked one flavor i may not have tried. Also they are all great!	1
This is a huge step up in quality from the kind that is normally available in the supermarkets near me. This makes green curry extremely easy. It also appears to have a pretty good shelf life which is good because there's enough in here to make several large portions, so unless you eat green curry all the time it will last quite a while.	1
This is a must for anyone's spice cabinet, but cannot find it in my area.  This is a very great product.	1
This is a must have if your a baker, I especially love it for my bundt tins that has to be greased perfectly.	1
This is a must have in my house for colds.  I bring a box to work to put in my desk and everyone asks for it when they come down with a cold.  Not for the individual who can't tolerate the flavor of anise or black licorice.	1
This is a nice fun gum.. Seems a little hard to chew at first.. but good for the purpose of easing up on sugar...	1
This is a really awesome and good deal for this twelve pack of gum. I will definitely order this product again.	1
This is a really good product and all members of my family enjoy beef jerky made with Nesco Jerky Works original spices.	1
This is a repurchase however, I had bought first set in retail.  Will purchase again in the future.	1
This is a translucent sort of opal look. Shiny. And it is a flake which adds a sort of translucent sparkle. Pretty.	1
This is a very effective product for making tasty jerky and it is easy to use as well. Easy to use with a few additional marinades to enhance the jerky flavor if desired.	1
This is a very good product. I wanted to order more but it has doubled the price in 2 weeks. Why? I will be ordering it elsewhere for a more sensible price.	1
This is a wonderful product to hasten the preparation of a wonderful Thai curry. We use all of the various products from Mae Ploy and find them delicious. All natural and no preservatives is an added bonus... I highly recommend you give them a try but caution they are quite spicy if you are not a big spicy food eater I suggest just adding a small amount to start.	1
This is a wonderful spice.  Goes great on everything!	1
This is all my husband uses for his base seasoning on all jerky he makes. Delicious!	1
This is as close as you'll get to that amazing best ever cup of coffee you had in the restaurant that used the liquid.	1
This is as known and trusted brand.  Using this makes it easy to make jerky from hamburger.	1
This is awesome stuff. Wow.	1
this is awesomeits not too spicy and its not just plainif u don't like spicy jerky its just right	1
This is by far my favorite brand of gum and their cinnamint is the best cinnamon out there - no question. My only gripe is everyone seems to only stock the peppermint or wintergreen these days and those sickly sweet weird combos of gum flavors. So I have to resort to getting my mom to ship it to since I am stationed in Germany or now thanks to Amazon, I can order it myself! Thank you!	1
This is by far my most favorite gum flavor.  It is both sweet and fresh.  I recommend it to anyone who likes mint and fresh breath.	1
This is by far the best coffee I have ever had. I'm not a coffee snob but I know good coffee when I drink it. This is it. I like my coffee plain and black. It has a nice smooth taste with no after taste. I also drink their decaf version. It's not sold at any stores here in Texas that I know of so I was glad to see Amazon sold it. I'd be very upset if I couldn't get this coffee anymore.	1
This is by far the best jerky seasoning available.  So easy to use.  I mix the cure and seasoning packets with water in a large ziploc bag, add the meat then marinate overnight.  We have used many different jerky seasonings and have always had the most compliments on the Nesco brand.	1
This is exactly what I wanted! This is the original mix that came with my Harvest Dehydrator . I could not find a store that carried it and was thrilled to find it through Amazon. I suggest for those who like it extra spicy, to add some crushed red peppers and teriyaki sauce.	1
This is excellent. Each pack makes two pounds of beef jerky. I also added smoked paprika, garlic powder and liquid smoke. Tastes great. Will buy again.	1
This is good stuff and a great value. Huge container. More spicy than your supermarket variety.	1
This is good stuff. Not too strong, not too mild. Easy to spice up with garlic, season salt, worhcester sauce or soy sauce. My first deer of the season has been consumed in the form of jerky. Family can't get enough.	1
this is good!	1
This is great espresso at an unbelievable price.  I used to own a espresso cart and now that I am stuck to a home brewer this is a great pod at a great price.  Amazon sells this far cheaper than anyone else.  Arrived in two days which makes them the fastest too.  Thanks	1
This is great jerky seasoning and curing kit  I tried the spicy first.  and Yes it is.  Mixes easily into meat.	1
This is hands down the best Jerky seasoning. I love it, and so does everyone that eats my meat!	1
This is honestly my favorite tasting peanut butter ever. I eat a spoon full with my cereal and LOVE it!	1
This is just was it says it is and really good.	1
This is Luna's BEST flavor. It is an excellent blend of chocolate and peppermint flavor. My teenage daughter first introduced me to Luna Bars and I had them in the house for her. I love these for a quick breakfast or after exercising. My husband has now become addicted to the peppermint and, after trying other flavors, we have the peppermint and lemon coming on a monthly basis!	1
This is my 3rd box.  Love the flavor.  Marinate meat for a full 24 hours before dehydrating. You'll be glad you did.	1
This is my all time favorite tea.....love it!	1
This is my father's favorite brand of seasoning to use when he makes venison jerky. We buy it every year!	1
This is my favorite	1
This is my favorite flavor of any gum because the sweetness take a little of the sting off the mint. Flavor lasts a while too. We keep our pantry stocked with it.	1
This is my favorite flavor of gum and even in a multipack it stays fresh for months thanks to some excellent packaging and keeping it in the dark pantry!	1
This is my favorite flavor!  Everyone in the family loves it!  I have made homemade beef jerky with other brands of seasoning, and they just don't taste as good and fresh as the Nesco seasonings do!  I will always buy the Nesco brand!	1
This is my favorite gum-- and at this price, it is an excellent deal (I typically pay $3.50 at the grocery store for a 3-pack). I like that it lasts a long time and doesn't have any sugar.	1
This is my favorite gum flavor. very tasty.	1
This is my favorite gum, and I can no longer find it in any store!!	1
This is my favorite gum, it has the minty freshness to knock out food or coffee breath but the bubblegum flavor to make it taste good.  I keep this in my car always and never get tired of it.	1
This is my favorite gum.  I like getting it in large quantities.  Keeps me from having to go to the store so often	1
This is my favorite gum. It maintains its flavor for a very long time, and also remains pleasingly elastic when chewed. Other gum I've tried becomes tough shortly after you begin chewing.	1
This is my favorite jerky mix	1
This is my favorite jery seasoning hands down!	1
This is my favorite non stick spray.	1
This is my favorite spice. It is what it says, Hot and Spicy. All their flavors are really good.	1
This is my favorite tea, and buying the 6 pack was a great value compared to purchasing at a health food store.  No sweetener is required, thanks to the licorice root and it is simply delicious!	1
This is my first time making jerky and this is a good starter pack. Different flavors to see what you like.	1
This is my 'go to' dry rub for pork ribs on the grill. Everyone	1
This is my go-to curry! I just wish the stores in my town actually stocked it.	1
This is my go-to gum. It isn't too strong, it lasts a long while, and it doesn't stick to my teeth.	1
This is my go-to jerky spice. Very very good!	1
This is my second bottle.  No comparision to grocery store pure vanilla, and it is a better value.	1
This is my sons favorite snack for school easy and healthy.  Arrived on time and priced right no complaints. Happy with purchase.	1
This is my, and my wife's, favorite flavor. Each pack works for one pound of raw ground beef. The garlic is noticable without being overpowering, and the pepper adds a nice touch. You should know how easy it is to use, just mix the dry ingredients with the ground beef, add the salt packet (we use about 2/3 of the salt), put the meat mixture in the jerky gun, press and dehydrate.	1
This is one of my Favorite Douwe Coffees similar to their Filter Blend! Robust with no acidity also a type of Blonde Roast	1
This is one of my top flavors of gum. It is smoother than most and won't make your eyes water (there's a time and a place for that) but still has a minty taste.	1
This is one of the nicest cake toppers I've seen. Lenox does a great job with the detail on this piece.	1
This is our favorite jerky seasoning and we've tried a lot of them!  Hint: If you use ground turkey, buy a 20 oz. package vs. a 16 oz package.  The seasoning tends to overwhelm a 16 oz pkg. of ground turkey.	1
This is our favorite jerky spice mix.  Tastes great with venison!	1
This is our FAVORITE pizza seasoning ever! My husband, kids and I love to make homemade pizza. We found this seasoning about 4 years ago in our local grocery store. After we used it up, we couldn't find it in town anywhere! Luckily, we can order it on Amazon. This seasoning will add so much delicious flavor to your pizza! :)	1
This is perfect for making my frosting a crisp white!	1
This is really a great flavor for jerky.  I will be ordering more.	1
This is really easy to use and tastes great! The kids had a fun time mixing it all up! We bought two boxes. Line your dehydrator though because the hamburger grease makes an awful mess! At least line the bottom	1
This is so simple to use and gives a professional look!	1
This is some great seasoning, but if you use the full pack of cure salt per pound, it is VERY salty. For me, it was just barely edible. I read some other reviewers saying that they only use 1/2 a pack of cure per pound and I'm going to try that on the next batch. I keep my jerky in the fridge and it's usually gone within a couple weeks, so the reduced cure salt shouldn't affect preservation.	1
This is some of the best coffee I've ever had, and I've had a lot of average, fancy and expensive kinds.  I was in a restaurant and had this coffee, it was so good I asked the waitress if she could fine out what kind it was.  She wrote it down for me and told me they get asked all the time.  It's so smooth and such a delightful flavor.  I love it!!!	1
This is some tasty stuff!	1
this is the best coffee	1
This is the best coffee ever.  I hope they never stop making it.	1
This is the best coffee for my new cappuccino machine. Very pleased with it. And I read on the package, when it is empty I can take it to Starbucks for free coffee.	1
This is the best coffee I have ever tasted! Thank you Douwe Egberts!!! The smell is amazing, and it is so good that there is no need for flavored creamer.	1
This is the best flavor of all of them, we have tried them all. I have purchased several boxes of these, and will be buying more!	1
this is the best flavored jerky mix  I have found. If I take a bag to work it disappears in a heart beat.	1
This is the best flavored protein bar!  This brand got it right!	1
This is the best flavoring you can get anywhere, I make alot of jerky & this is the best of the best.	1
This is the best JERKY flavoring for ground meat! So easy to use and the cost savings by being able to use Hamburger instead of prime cuts is 5 stars in my house of Jerky lovers!	1
This is the best jerky mix I have found.I add cracked pepper and some cayenne peeper just before drying.	1
This is the best jerky mix on the market today. It really tastes good. I prefer the original mix.	1
This is the best jerky seasoning out there, bar none.  Great flavors, the variety packs are perfect for changing it up.	1
THIS IS THE BEST JERKY SPICE ON THE MARKET, NOBODY EVEN COMES CLOSE TO IT.	1
This is the best jerky spice we have found.  However, if you are allergic to monosodium glutamate do not buy this.	1
This is the best non spicy jerly mix we have tried.  We used it on deer meat.	1
This is the best overall pizza and pasta spice I have ever used, and I use a lot and it is salt free! Buy some!!	1
This is the best pizza seasoning!  It is amazing the difference it makes when you are cooking a frozen pizza.  You forget the pizza was frozen to begin with.  We also use it on homemade pizza and we season pasta.  I used to buy this here in town, but couldn't find it anywhere.  So I thought of looking on Amazon and sure enough, there it was.  Thanks for carrying this.	1
This is the best Pizza/Pasta seasoning I've ever tasted. My local store doesn't carry it anymore, but luckily Amazon still does :)	1
This is the best seasoning mix we have tried, we like the taste of SlimJims and this is very close. We do mix 50/50 with the spicy seasoning when doing 10lb batches of venison snack sticks. Everybody who tries them, loves them.	1
This is the best seasoning that we have found, we do mix this 50/50 with the original flavor to tone it down a bit. It is a little hot for some so we tried this combination and it works perfect. We like the taste of slim jims and this mixed 50/50 is very close, we also use 30% smoked bacon mixed with our ground venison for the snack sticks and they get eaten fast.	1
This is the best seasoning we have found yet.  It really taste great we will only use this seasoning from now on,  The original is our favorite,	1
This is the best seasoning we've found so far for beef jerky	1
This is the best tasting seasoning for jerky that was ever made!  I added some more cracked hot pepper,1 1/3Tbs Soy Sauce,1/2Tbs fresh ground black Pepper, 3Tbs brown sugar, 1/3Tbs fresh ground garlic, 2Tbs wine,1/3Tbs Myers's rum,1/5 white vinegar and 1/2 cups water. Mixing one pack for (1 1/4 pounds) fresh ground beef( used 96/4 beef), & marinate.  Mixing good let soak for 6 hours.This is THE BEST jerky. A++++Highly recommended!	1
This is the BEST tasting seasoning for jerky that was ever made! The price is right and this is an excellent product. I love buying items through Amazon.com.  It has been a wonderful experience for me on every item that I have purchased! Thanks for making buying on line fun and confirming the idea of integrity and safety to purchasing on line.	1
This is the best vanilla I have ever used.	1
This is the easiest way to dye your cakes. I am a Wilton cake student; I started using this on my icing and royal icing. It won't water down the icing at all and the colors are more realistic.	1
this is the easiest way to make jerkyfrom ground beefmy wife loves itthe price is greatcons none	1
This is the exact same product I have bought and used for years that once was sold in Walmart stores in my area, however Walmart in my area no longer carries this brand and the brand they now carry is not very good. Nesco makes the best venison jerky, no other brand of equal or greater cost makes venison jerky as good as this Nesco.	1
This is the first Power Bar product I bought  and have stayed with it for many years.  Great flavor and keep me going..	1
This is the jerky spice that is made for my jerky machine. Be aware this used to be for 1 lb of meat now it is for 2 lb of meat.	1
This is the most amazing coffee!  I can drink it black it's so good.	1
THis is the most amazing jerky seasoning.  Just wish they sold it in 10,15,20,and 25 pond options.	1
This is the only jerky seasoning I like it is rally good	1
This is the only PowerBar I have ever tried that has not upset my stomach or made me constipated.  Seriously.  Very tasty, seems to be mostly natural ingredients, and delivers as promised.	1
This is the only way to keep coffee beans fresh as when I brought them home. With a few easy pumps of the VacuVin hand vacumn pump (the same system as I use with the VacuVin wine storage system) the container seals and the air is evacuated. This maintains the beans in the same state as when the were purchased in vacume packed bags.	1
this is the place to go for large qty. items beside Costco and Sam Club.  One good thing, you do not have to wait in the long lines.	1
This is the product I often chew. Nothing special about it but it is what it is. No complains so far	1
This is the real deal, tastes like restaurant Thai food.  Good value and easy to cook with.	1
This is the real deal. Authentic and delicious. Not a lot of fillers like some brands. It's pretty much solid spices. Just be aware that it is pretty spicy, unless you only use a little.	1
This is the same brand served in one of our nearby casinos, but hard to find.  Good coffee.	1
This is very tasty seasoning and it is great for those who cannot use a smoker to do jerky.	1
This is wonderful, filling cereal.  As part of a plan to improve my diet I began eating cooked cereal for breakfast every morning. This is a big part of that. It is very tasty, and filling.	1
This is yet another product no longer available at my local grocery store that I was happy to find on Amazon.  I really like to use this to doctor up frozen pizza's along with extra cheese, garlic and whatever else I may have on hand.	1
This is your basic Jerky seasoning.  I use it as my base then add my personal touches:  cracked peppercorn or diced jalopenos, etc.	1
This item arrived on time if not early. I have not had a chance to use this item yet but I would order from the same seller again.	1
This jerky seasoning is delicious. I used it to make deer jerky and was very happy with the results. I mixed it with the ground venison and let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Once in the dehydrator, I would occasionally sprinkle a small amount of the seasoning over the strips. The result was the best jerky I've ever made. I had to hide it from my family/coworkers in order to save some for myself!	1
This jerky seasoning is the best will be using it for years to come.	1
This leaves such a fun gold color on food. Easy to apply and didn't rub off	1
This made my cake go from cute to adorable in a very fun 2 minutes! It added the perfect finishing touch, and I have bought more colors to try out in the future. The only thing is that the can does not go very far, this can covered 1 double layer 8in round cake exactly.	1
This makes a great little gift for a housewarming. Paul Prudhomme's seasonings will make your dishes taste great, and for 7 different spice blends, the price is right, too.	1
This makes a lot of food taste great - subs, deep fried mushrooms, pizza.	1
This makes awesome jerky.	1
This makes jerky making fun and easy.  Simple to use and easy to clean when you're done.	1
This marinade makes some of the best jerky. Great flavor with just a little kick.  Great product and I definitely recommend it.	1
This mixed so well with the icing! Made a great gender reveal cake!	1
This Nesco Jerky is the bomb.  For being made with Hamburger you really can't go wrong with this.	1
This original jerky seasoning is my all time favorite.  Everyone loves this flavor.  Works great.  I only use 1/2 of the salt.	1
this package a complete surprise after some thought. I originally believed this to be one flavor but the 3 that came where good.	1
This paste is a bit mouth hurting hot, but once I figured out the right mix, it was great.  You cannot beat this for making green curry dishes of any kind.  I may even use this in flavoring some rice.	1
This paste is delicious. The perfect balance of spice, shrimp, kaffir lime, and other spices. Even a little of this paste adds tons of flavor. I use it with coconut milk, veggies, and chicken and serve it over rice. It tastes as good as what I get at my favorite Thai restaurant! You can adjust the spice level since you add as much or as little paste as you want.	1
This paste is much stronger and spicier than the small bottles you find at the local grocer. Great for thai curry chicken with coconut and a little goes a long ways!	1
This paste is smashing.  Great flavor and easy to prepare.	1
This pear color mist sprays wonderfully and leaves a beautiful pearly sheen on the chocolates, cake and fondant I have used it on. No taste, though it does have a slight smell after spraying that goes away after air drying. It's not enough to stop me from using it though! Highly recommended!	1
This piece was so beautiful!!!! it's going to look awesome sitting on top of my wedding cake and then on my mantle as a show piece after!!!!  It's a must for those who want a lifetime of memories and it'll make a wonderful heirloom..	1
This press set is great! The designs you can do are endless. Makes every cake you do look professionally created!	1
This product arrived earlier than expected which is good. It made my sugar laced premade peacock look simply amazing!	1
This product arrived in a timely manner & is a perfect seasoning for my beef jerky.  Very satisfied!	1
This product arrived quickly and the sprinkles were perfect for decorating St Patrick Day cookies. I do wish there were more little green shamrocks in the bottle but other than that they were spectacular.	1
This product does what it says it will do.  I love my set and am very glad I purchased it.  Do take note that I don't use it for cake but fish biscuits instead.  Check out the user images to see an example of my finished product I made with this set.	1
This product helps transform you into a beautiful cinnamon roll too good for this world, too shiny and chrome.	1
This product is does what its says I find having this every morning gives me a boost with breathing.	1
This product is excellent	1
This product is so amazing.  It's the only brand/flavor I order.  Family and friends can't get enough of it!	1
This product is so good, I make jerky all the time for my family and I use these mixes to flavor the food. I know there are other people out there who make their own spices for there jerky, I can tell you this is worth a try if your in a rush to fill up a bug out bag for a friend or for yourself.	1
This product is soooo nice . I didn't know there was a difference between food coloring and candy coloring . It made it a lot easier to make different colors for chocolate after I ordered this product	1
This product is very good and I would recommend it to everyone.. Will continue to buy this product.... Very good..	1
This product is very good...my kids enjoy picking their own colors to dye their icing for their cupcakes	1
This product made some delicious desserts for a high end restaurant through the holidays. Easy to use and looks beautiful on blackberries.	1
This product makes the MOST delicious jerky - we use it with ground bison and it's outstanding - much much better than any pre-made jerky.	1
This product seems to have lots of reviews from folks that are mad. Max reviews seem to be some kind of vague references. Cakes painted in this come out a little too shiny, and have a slight chrome tint. It was a great thing to witness a chef use this spray. I had to holla at my friend Val when she used this for the first time.	1
This product shipped quickly and I purchase it from this vendor often.  It is a reasonable price, and Myoplex is the best tasting protein shake around.	1
This product was purchased the Nesco FD-61WHC dehydrator. It works well in the production of jerky. It is a little heavy on the salt so I add a little extra meat. Would definitely purchase again.	1
This project is PERFECT for coloring melted chocolate because it is NOT water based.  I want more colors !  Great product!	1
This provides nice vibrant colors for candy melts, lip balm, and other oil based products.	1
This really glammed up my Yoga Christmas Cookies.  They were a huge hit.  The yoga instructor couldn't stop talking about them.  It was (almost) embarrassing.	1
This sauce is great on almost anything, partifcularly fried chicken, eggs, meatloaf, and french fries. It is not too hot and has a light hint of garlic and a tiny bit of sweetness. My favorite supermarket has stopped stocking it and I can't imagine why. Magic Pepper sauce beats tobasco sauce in my opinion.	1
This seasoning is a little different than others on the market.  It has a full, tasty flavor that is far more than red and black pepper. I use it on all kinds of foods.	1
This seasoning is by far the best for making jerky. We add our own spice to it to make it hotter. Its outstanding!	1
This seasoning is delicious. Perfect amount of seasoning for a pound of meat. I get compliments every time I make jerky with it.	1
This seasoning is granular powder and does not become a brick like the earlier did. Much easier to mix into meat for even flavoring.	1
This seasoning is great! I've purchased this several times and use it to make ground beef jerky with my NESCO dehydrator (the square white one). It is always a hit wherever I bring it and everyone loves this flavor! While I'm sure I could try to find my own seasoning to match this or come close, getting all the mixed seasonings and the curing packets for this price make it a great deal!	1
This seasoning is great, not too salty	1
This seasoning is perfect for seasoning meats. It adds flavor, but doesn't become an overwhelming taste to the food you prepare.	1
This seasoning is so good it's dangerous (not & spicy) every time my son takes some of my jerky to work people beg him to let them buy some from him it's so delicious.  It's the kind of product you want to stockpile just I'm case they ever stop making it!	1
This seasoning is the best	1
This seasoning is the best. Great for all pizza and any pasta dish. Hard to find in a grocery store.	1
This seasoning is the only thing I use on ribs, chicken and hamburgers - excellent!	1
This seasoning tastes delicious on every kind of meat. We've used it on red meat, chicken, and even salmon. Getting the 24oz can is definitely worth it because this seasoning should be used liberally. I have no negative comments about this product. Give it a try!	1
This set designer pattern is excellent, help me to decorate my cakes and have beautifull apperearence. I recommend this product.	1
This set is great! Not too runny or too thick. I used it on some white chocolate fudge I made and it worked just as I expected	1
This spice blend is so delightful I can hardly find words. If Mr. Prudhomme ever stops making it I'll be beside myself! I put it on EVERYTHING. It's so good it will make your home cooked meals pop alive with flavor and your family and guests will rave and wonder how you do it.	1
This spray gave me the energy to take on Furiosa	1
This spray goes on lightly, adding a gold sheen to food, flowers etc. It is especially nice for older people and special occasions. I am hoping to use it in place of frosting, (less sugar), for holiday cookies.	1
This spray is a time saver. I am so glad I have it on my shelf now!	1
This spray is amazing. Previously I just used a light dusting of silver to give this look, but it wasn't the same.I recently used this on cream cheese mints and they looked AMAZING.  No added taste or stickiness.	1
This spray was shiny, chrome, and delicious, but it didn't get me into Valhalla. I died in battle. I had witnesses, but I was turned away at the gates. They told me that I had died an unheroic death because I had died while trying to kill an ex cop and a bunch of women. They said if I let a one armed woman, a pregnant lady, and a couple of grandmas throw me under an armor spiked Volkswagon Beetle then I couldn't be expected to fight in the next life..	1
This sprinkle assortment is great. I bake alot and love to use new decorations. The decorations in most store are quite limited. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of cookies this assortment decorated. I am always looking for new and different sugars and sprinkles to decorate cookies and cakes.  There are many different kinds. These decorations come from Wilton products. Check them out too.	1
This stuff cleared me up after daily drinking for a few months every evening.  Now I am permanently clear enough that I only have to drink it when I am sick, or when there is a lot of pollen in the air.  The only bad thing is the taste, so I add cinnamon and honey to mask the taste.	1
This stuff covered very well. I did not eat it, so I cannot say anything about that, but if you want a metallic looking gold on whatever it is you're making, this product really works.	1
This stuff has a bite to it, so start with a little and adjust from there.We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it, and WOW!!!!! burn your lips off hot..We have since learned to cut the rub with a bit of brown sugar and comes out perfect..	1
This stuff is amazing. A great assortment at a great price.	1
This stuff is awesome	1
This stuff is awesome.See my Nesco dehydrator review...my brothers and friends think I am a jerky guru !!!	1
This stuff is great!	1
This stuff is great! Follow the directions on the pack and pop your meat in the dehydrator, smoker, whatever. This is the best tasting pre-made mix i've used.	1
This stuff is GREAT! The flavor is really good and better than the stuff that I have bought at a local Price Chopper. It only takes a little bit to kick up the heat on your curry. I will definitely be ordering this again when I run out.	1
This stuff is great! Used it to make thin Oreos look like pirate gold! They looked fabulous	1
This stuff is great. Super simple, everything is right there, and it tastes great! I've used it for strips and ground meat for venison and beef. Use it as a dry rub for ground meat and with water for cut strips.  I'll continue to buy this product.	1
This stuff is great. You can also use it for hard candy. That's what I use it for and it works perfectly.	1
This stuff is HOT.  But it has serious flavor, too.  I find I want to eat it more than once a week.  Start out using a quarter of that suggested on the label.  I will be a MAE PLOY fan until  ....	1
This stuff is really good. Better than stuff you buy pre made. You should buy the nesco jumbo jerky kit. That caulk gun is the only way to go.	1
This stuff makes for some,  Great Tasting Jerky !	1
This stuff makes great tasting jerky! The whole family loves this stuff. I add two tablespoons of brown sugar with each pound I make!!	1
This stuff never fails to help make a great base for an excellent Thai curry!!!  It does have a kick to it spice wise.	1
This stuff rocks on eggs or in chili. Highly recomended. It provides a rich warmth without being as sharp as Tobasco, and has a lot of layers of flavor. Unfortunately none of my local grocery stores carry it anymore, so I order it six-at-a-time from Amazon when I need replacements. I hope that they never stop making it...	1
This stuff taste great and super easy to mix. I let it marinade for at least 24 hrs. Great buy if you don't want to mix your own seasonings and want something quick and easy.	1
This stuff tastes GREAT!	1
This stuff works. Not sure why, but it does.	1
this tastes even better than you can imagine	1
This tastes just like restaurant curry and is the best curry blend I have bought.	1
This tea has helped me through bronchitis twice and whenever I get the sniffles which always goes down into my chest. Plus it tastes really good, too.  I put a bag or two in my water mug and drink it all day.	1
This tea is a taste you have to acquire, but its medicinal quality works to help my lungs open up so I can breathe better when they become congested.	1
This tea is great and quite helpful to take when one experiences any respiratory issues.I find it very healing and it tastes good too.	1
This tea is incredible ! After having only two cups, I feel a difference in My breathing. I suffer from allergies, and This tea helpsrelieve congestion as well as any OTC remedies I've tried. And,,, Its natural !!	1
This Tea really works My mother drinks it 2 times a dayThis Tea really works My mother drinks it 2 times a day	1
This tea tastes good and it's perfect for asthma to use in combination with your asthma medicine. It will also work when you have difficulty breathing and you don't feel like taking your asthma medicine. It is also great for when you run out of asthma medicine and you can't get a refill for a few days.	1
This tea works absolutely the best for me when I have upper respiratory congestion related to seasonal pollen.	1
This variety pack is great All flavors are good.  Fast delivery also.	1
This was a beautiful cake topper for my stepdaughters wedding.	1
This was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.  I'm not a huge gum person but the flavor (at least the peppermint) does last QUITE some time.  It lasted a train a 2 hour train trip.  Either way just awesome ... (can't think of anything else to say)	1
This was a great buy and I can also say it makes cake decorating so very easy. Very Good Product.	1
This was a great deal, will be great stocking stuffers.  Was fresh not stale, really great value.  Will have some very happy children on Christmas morning.	1
This was a great way to buy gum.  It is much better priced than buying it at the store in 3 packs.	1
This was cheaper than walmart, I wasn't in a rush so I ordered it online.  Very happy to get my jimmies so now I can decorate with all my colors! :)	1
This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast. So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job.	1
This was my favorite out of all of the ones we used!! Sooo good!!	1
This was my first foray into gel food coloring. I use it to dye cookies, cake batter, and icings, which it works wonderfully for. You only need a tiny bit to get bold color (which doesn't fade in the oven) and it doesn't change the taste or texture of your baked goods. I would highly recommend this, especially if you've never used gel before. The difference is amazing. Be careful with it, though-- it's also quite good at coloring hands and counter tops!	1
This was my second time ordering these. Definitely worth buying. Great taste and great price. This box had some spilled in it, but I was refunded and I plan to purchase again.	1
This was nice and they work great	1
This was ordered for my husband and he loves it.	1
This was perfect for my project. I made a Disney Princess Castle cake for a little girl's birthday and this gave the shimmer I was looking for. I would definitely buy this product again!	1
this was purchased as a gift for a neighbor. i had given them a dehydrator and they expressed an interest in making jerky.	1
This was purchased for my niece a first time bride that is marrying in the fall. The platinum detailing is just wonderful in all the right places and not too overdone. As a family we liked that the facial features are not real prominent . We liked that look who wants a cake topper that looks like someone else as that it usually the case with most bride and groom toppers. This has a feeling of an heirloom quality it could be easily passed down it is has a timeless look.	1
This was really fun to add a sparkle to a cake after it was finished. It really made the cake look great and professional.	1
This was the first time I bought something from USA. Now I'v got my package. I love the color, I mix it with creams. The color is beautiful. The most important thing is I just need a little every time.	1
This Wedding cake topper is absolutely gorgeous and far exceeded our expectations.  My fiance and I were looking for a topper that we could later store and admire in our dining room hutch for years to come and this was exactly what we were looking for. Beautiful, elegant and timeless.	1
This will enable my granddaughter to add to the color palette of icings she uses in decorating cupcakes.  She likes to impress her friends at school so this will be great	1
This wonderful product allows me to die with honour on the Fury Road, all shiny and chrome. Witness me!	1
This worked great for us, and we really enjoyed the different flavors.  Have already bought more flavor packets for future use.	1
This worked great on cupcakes with a vanilla frosting -- no one could believe how easy it was or even that such a thing existed!	1
This worked really well for us.  I bought this to use to color the white icing on my daughter's birthday cake a Frozen color blue.  My husband did the spraying.  He took the cake outside and held the sprayer a good distance from the cake and gave it a real light like in the air spritz so that only a light layer of the color landed on the cake.  And the blue was the perfect color!  But you must be careful because if you spray this too close it does get dark and heavy.	1
This works so great!!!  I love it!!!  So easy!!	1
This works very well to keep my lungs breathing easily.  Since I like the taste of licorice, this tastes good to me.  I drink this every morning during allergy season or when I have been exposed to mold and mildew.  I've used this product for over 15 years, and still prefer it over other choices (despite the formula change when ephedra was removed).  I am an acupuncturist and Chinese Herbalist, and find this an inexpensive way to take Bi Yan Pian (which is in the tea).	1
THIS!  I LOVE THIS!  My buttercream frosting is white instead of yellow.  I can color the frosting and have it be true to color.  My red velvet cake is actually RED.  I just hope that it is relatively safe for consumption, because it goes in most of my cakes and frostings now.	1
Timeless. Beautiful.	1
Timely arrively of product. Item exactly as described.	1
timo vendedor e produto, comprei e chegou muito rpido antes do esperado, vou comprar muito mais de vocs. muito obrigado por tudo.	1
tis the season for baking. The colors are bright and very pretty.	1
To be honest, I really don't like PowerBars...EXCEPT for this flavor, that is!I'm not sure what it is exactly, but the Wild Berry flavored PowerBars are SO good and SO tasty that I simply must have a constant supply at all times. I never cared much for any of the other flavors, but for some reason the taste and texture of this one is perfect.	1
To me this is a great deal and is some of the best I've ever had, I'm hooked on this product.	1
Too stiff to use	1
Tried it and love it	1
Tried several flavored and prefer this one.	1
Tried some store bought seasoning for our deer jerky and it didn't taste so great. Nesco has the best seasoning I just use half of the salt it asks for.	1
Tried this at a restaurant.  Had to try it again. By far the BEST!	1
TRIED THIS AT HARRAH'S AND LIKED IT - SAME GOOD COFFEE - ALSO ORDERED THE INTENSE DARK ROAST - THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER FOR BOTH - WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER	1
Tried this coffee for the first time at a bed and breakfast and was instantly hooked. It is the smoothest coffee I have ever consumed and the only one I can drink black. Little to no bitter aftertaste and easy on the stomach.	1
Trusted Brand	1
twice as fast as the old one works very well	1
Two words small and great	1
Unbeatable price, and great for the whopper lover.	1
Unlike most sport bars it does not taste like sawdust.It tastes a lot like gummy bears and the difference is mostly a natural vs. processed flavor.They are less sticky/messy than gels and are bite-sized unlike bars.	1
Use of this product leads to 10 Oscar nominations, so I highly, highly recommend.	1
Use the paste sparingly if you do not like pepper. We had to open the windows as the scent was overwhelming. This sauce delivers such a fabulous flavor, I am sure it will not last long. We made shrimp curry and cannot wait to try different meats.	1
Use these in my candy making and they are beautiful vibrant colors	1
USE THESE TO PAINT MY HUSBANDS PILLS, THAT ALL LOOK THE SAME.  WORKS GREAT AND HE DOESN'T GET THEM MIXED UP!!	1
Use this everytime I make sauce or pizza. Delicious. A little spicy.	1
Use this for all my beef and deer jerky!	1
Use this with ground to make slim jims, and add dried ground Habs.  Great.	1
used for gift bags for my Sunday school kids at Easter.  Well received, of course.  Will buy again for sure.	1
Used for making red and green caramel corn for Christmas. Wasn't sure how the food coloring would work with the caramel, but these created great, vibrant colors. (They did darken a little after baking the caramel corn, but were still fairly bright.)Great product and will last me a long time.	1
Used for Minnie Mouse cupcakes - worked great!!	1
used for my cake. I will use purple, yellow and pink for my next cake. Highly recommend. Thank you .	1
Used for rock candy and the colors were very vibrant.	1
Used in Wilton candy melts to make more vibrant colors. Absolutely fantastic. Easy to use.	1
Used it on this Optimus Prime Cake.  Was pretty spectacular.  Decepticons eat your heart out.If Optimus Prime can't get into Vahalla, there is no hope for the rest of us.	1
Used nesco seasoning for a long time and I love it	1
Used some - still have plenty more for other cookies/birthdays!  And who doesn't love sprinkles?  Colore are nice a bright.	1
used them for my chocolate covered pretzel sticks	1
Used these as oil dye for oil lamps.  Pretty colors.  Doesn't take too much dye to color a candle.	1
Used these for my husbands 40th Surprise birthday.  I put these on the black candy bar. They were great. I did end up finding them cheaper after I had purchased them	1
Used these on cupcakes and they looked great!	1
Used these to dye kids play sand.. worked great for that	1
Used these to make icing for sugar cookies. Didn't take a whole lot of tint to make beautiful cookies. NExt up, rainbow layered cake.	1
Used this for a War Boy costume in a bike ride.  Blasted the whole can up my face and did not die.  I therefore recommend this product	1
Used this for my cupcakes and sprayed the icing. It works good and looks amazing!	1
Used this in homemade frosting on cookies we made over Thanksgiving Holiday.  The colors were beautiful and vibrant.  Cleaned up easily.	1
Used this on a couple desserts for our wedding. Works well.	1
Used this on a Wizard of Oz project. I would definitely use this again.	1
Used this product for years, never disappoints.	1
Used this to color cakes for a birthday party and I was extremely impressed with how vibrant the colors were.  Will definitely buy again.	1
Used this to create a butter look to my daughter's popcorn cupcakes. LOOOVE this stuff and can't believe I have not tried this sooner!	1
Used this with venison. It's really good.	1
used to color white chocolate for lollipop molds.  gives great color, just wish it had dropper bottles instead of the little jars it comes in as these can be messy	1
Used to decorate cakes , cookies, and candy. Love vibrant color. Will definitely purchase again. Lovely addition to home baked gifts.	1
Used to decorate cookies, the kids loved them.  They did  not complain of any funny scents or taste.  The adults thought they were a nice addition to the party and thought I bought the cookies with the glitter.	1
Used with ground turkey and came out great	1
useing it now , will rate later	1
Using these now - we love them!  They were for a wedding for a cupcake bar and had left over - they are great	1
Using this organic vanilla extract allows the pure scent and flavor to shine in my gluten-free baking.  Love this product!	1
Valhalla awaits! Dont let the harsh taste and burning on your gums to deter you! With Wilton can in hand, you hold the key to Valhalla!Go forth, you will be witnessed!	1
Vegas cook loves the taste these seasoning give to food.	1
Verified shiny and chrome!Wait... Oh God! It burns!	1
Very beautiful, vibrant color! The color is easy to blend into the frosting and takes very little to create the needed color.	1
Very bright and customizable!	1
Very bright and vibrant for my use in making bath bombs/fizzers	1
very convenient and practical to have all those sprinkle in one place, it when on easy and that we like when you are cooking with kids	1
very delicious! good for a quick snack or meal replacement. Complimented with water and itll go down smooth. good and nutritious	1
Very easy to use and just the right flavor.	1
Very fast delivery with great quality	1
Very fresh (BB date 09/2017).  A treat memory from childhood..what fun!  Good thing there are 6 containers because I think the first one may be gone in a couple of days.  Will need to put the rest out of sight (and hopefully out of mind!).	1
Very fresh not broken up I highly recommend these I'll be ordering in them again	1
very good and delicious	1
Very good and even better knowing it is organic. Like I said I will continue buying this product.i do a lot of  cooking.	1
Very good and good pricel	1
very good and very Tasty	1
Very good assortment of flavor.  I cannot make fast enough for my friends and co-workers.Very easy to use!.Thank you very much for these.	1
Very good coffee!	1
Very good coffee, would definitely recommend but I would suggest buying these in-store where you can see the expiry date before you purchase. These arrived on October 23 and the expiry date is in January. This bag would most likely be used out before then but I would have liked for the expiry date to be further away.	1
very good concentrated color. A little goes a long way and the colors are just beautiful. The colors you can create with this box are endless and make cookie/cake decorating even more fun. Easy to store and I just use a clean toothpick to pull a little from the jar to add to whatever I want to color. Nice that they don't water down whatever you are coloring.	1
VERY GOOD DEAL THIS IS THE MIX THAT I HAVE EVER FOUND BEEN USING THIS BRAND FOR A LONG TIME, THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Very good deal! We make deer jerky every year.	1
Very good decoration for Halloween skull cake.	1
Very good flavor	1
Very good flavor on pork chops. Makes them a little spicy so they have a bite to them, in addition the BBQ flavor.	1
Very good flavor w/good chewability.	1
Very good flavor!!!	1
Very good flavor, and a bargain for the price.	1

Very good quality vanilla at a good price. With a family of 6 we go through baking ingredients quickly and were glad to find this as part of the Subscribe and Save listing of items.	1
Very good seasoning for hamburger jerky.  The only kind I ever use.	1
Very good seasoning to make my jerky	1
very good smoky taste. i will buy again	1
Very good spices and easy to use.	1
Very good spices, easy to use, great results, great low price. Love these will be purchasing more in the future.	1
Very good vanilla extract and organic too! This comes in a close second to my homemade organic vanilla extract. Will keep a bottle in my cabinet, while waiting for mine to develop.	1
Very good vanilla extract, yes there is a difference in regular McCormick artificially flavored vanilla. This is actually an extract of real vanilla beans plus its organic to boot. Definately get this one if you want true vanilla flavor.	1
Very good with a lot of depth.  Good to be able to fall back on when no time available re work etc.	1
Very good with sliced meat, a tad salty, but that's jerky for you. I used it with venison, buffalo and beef. Just bake it at 275 for 10 minutes when its off the dehydration machine to be safe.	1
Very good, not too hot, watch the amount of tenderizer, excess sodium	1
Very good, will buy again.	1
Very good.	1
very good. feels like im back home in miami!	1
very good~!!! :D	1
Very great flavor and taste, not too salty either! Nice to see this product is locally made in my area!	1

Very nice, tastes great	1
Very nice, used these in conditioner to make a natural toner. Worked perfectly	1
Very nice.  Spicy and hot, Easy to prepare, takes some elbow grease and some time and care but making the beef jerky is fun and interesting.  Very tasty once it's done.  Thanks.	1
Very nice.thank you	1
Very nice.thank you	1
Very pleased with my order	1
very pretty. good pigment	1
VERY pricey but the finished product was adorable	1
Very pricey online but just as expected	1
Very relaxing and soothing, whether you have a head cold or not. Pleasant taste.	1
Very satisfied with the item I purchased.	1
Very simple to use & great texture/flavour for the jerky. Both ground meat & sliced meat jerkies were better with this product. Great for beginners	1
Very simple to use and I was able to use just enough to give the cake a touch of silver on the edges.	1
Very smooth and delicious coffee. After visiting the netherlands I decided to try and find some dutch coffee back in the states. It's nearly the same to what I had while I was visiting. Easy to drink, and it's delicious.	1
Very smooth flavor.	1
Very soothing for asthma and colds.	1
Very spicy!	1
Very tasty	1
Very tasty and easy to make.	1
Very tasty snack with some milk. Some of the links were broken, but it should be expected.	1
Very tasty, if you've had Luna bars before, this one is on the sweeter side and more Chocolatey, like a dessert!	1
Very tasty.  Some were broken in half but that happens at the store as well.  Will certainly purchase again.	1
very vibrant colors...I will get lots of use out of these...especially dirning the holidays..very nice...lots of color...lots of fun,,thankyou wilton	1
Very yum flavour if you like spiced gum, the cinnamint is pretty good one apart from my favourite wintermint, spearmint and bubble mint flavours.	1
Very yummy I'll buy again	1
Very-very good. The product gives me all the vital nutrients that I need. Sticky! Hard to swallow sometimes so I wash it down with water or coffee! One single bar combined with a banana wil make a complete breakfast! Easy to digest! Does not feel bulky!	1
Vibrant colors! Enjoy the gel--does not affect consistency or taste. Easy to use. Will purchase again.	1
Vibrant colors. Very pleased with this purchase. You only need a tiny amount to jazz the place up! Be careful not to overdo it!	1
Vibrant colors. You can control how dark or light you want it to go and a little goes a long way. It's a bit messy though and will stain clothes, even your fingers for a day or two so I would recommend using gloves. I used a toothpick to grab small amounts at a time until I got the color I wanted.	1
Vibrant, as described. thank you !!	1
Vivid amazing colors	1
Waiting for a long time, but the goods is very satisfied. I think I will buy again.	1
Wanted a wedding gift and Macys no longer had something nice like this - and was pleased with the discounted price.	1
Was a gift for my Dad; he loves his French vanilla creamer	1
Was a gift for my husband who makes deer jerky all the time.  He found it easy to use and clean.  Great product for the price,  no need to pay more.	1
Was able to enter Valhalla without a hitch.	1
Was good!	1
Was really easy to add creative flair to cupcakes and cake. Made it really easy to decipher what kind of cake is under the frosting at parties.	1
Way more expensive than if you can find it in the store, but worth it.	1
way more gun than I needed ha, but great little package and quality	1
Way tasty	1
We absolutely love these spices! They are our go to spices for any dish. The one for poultry is so good we needed to buy a large container of the Poultry one as it is used so much (found it in the supermarket). Also makes a great gift!	1
we all love this jerky mix	1
We all love this spice seasoning.  Not too spicy, but just enough.  Arrived quickly.	1
We always use this vanilla.  It is wonderful for homemade ice cream, cookies, and cakes!	1
We cook curry at least once a week.  This stuff is amazing.  Same with the red and yellow.  A must have for the amateur curry cook.	1
We couldn't find Chef Pauls season salt in our rural area so we went to the company web site and ordered.  This is a like a large sampler of different seasons for seafood, vegy's, meat and poultry.  Each salt is unique and with a little trial and error may work well in ways not intended.	1
We exactly as expected. Fast shipping.	1
We have become coffee snobs, after trying Douwe Egberts in a local restaurant my husband was dying to have it at home. We got the name from our server but could not find it locally, so I thought Amazon has everything let me check. Of course you guys had it and we now have a subscription for monthly delivery's of our favorite coffee it is sooo good.	1
We have been using Nesco jerky spice for a while now. My family loves the flavor. I recommend this to anyone who loves jerky. Quick easy and so yummy.	1
We have been using Poultry magic for a while now, and love it.  My son told us about the meat magic, but in our small town, we couldn't find it.This is a great pack of four.  I was suprised that the vegetable magic is spicy.  Won't use a lot, but will use it.Can't wait to use the seafood magic.  Great products.	1
We have been using this blend for years.  We let it merinade longer than time on the box suggests and it was better this time.	1
We have been using this tea during cold and flu season for many years now. I first found it in the grocery store, but they no longer carry it, so I have to get it here now. The flavor is good, even my children will ask for it when they are not feeling well. It definitely helps to ease symptoms of a head cold.	1
We have bought these retail for years, but haven't been able to get them lately. These are the exact same item, and at a reasonable price.	1
we have made many batckes of jerky great product.	1
We have sued this before. The price was reasonable but the shipping cost was not.	1
We have tried 4 different brands of jerky seasoning and this is our favorite.  It is also the least expensive of those we tried making it an excellent value.  In addition, the individual packets for 1lb of meat eliminated the need for measuring.  We highly recommend this seasoning.	1
We have tried many kinds of hot sauce, but this one is the best. It's not real hot, but has a wonderful spicy garlic flavor, that complements any food you are serving. If you are looking for great flavor in a hot sauce, this one is definitely one to try...	1
We have used Paul's seasonings for many years.  Have also tried dozens of others.  These are the best of the lot.	1
We have used this seasoning for many years.  Everyone loves it!  It is the best!!!!	1
WE HAVEN'T HAD ALL THE FLAVORS, BUT WHAT WE HAVE HAD WERE VERY GOOD. IF YOU LIKE JERKY THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TRY FOR ANYONE	1
We like to put in on sliced Zucchini and Barbecue in on the grill.	1
We live in NYC and this stuff goes for $14-15 per bag in most stores. Amazon's price (3 for $23) is an amazing discount. Plus, this coffee is excellent. Five stars.	1
WE LIVE. WE DIE. WE LIVE AGAIN. Also, worked great for my niece's Toothless inspired Birthday cake, so there's that.	1
We love all of the flavors!	1
We love it! Awesome, strong, curry flavor. Best one we've had so far!	1
we love the taste of this seasoning...	1
we love them,	1
We love this blend and it will last us for years. Best price around.	1
We love this flavor! I was introduced to this brand when I bought the jerky gun. It had 5 packs in with it. A simple process that gives plenty of flavor! A must have choice for all jerky makers!	1
We love this jerky seasoning. We use it to make venision/deer jerky. Everyone that we give a piece of it to eat just loves the flavor. Will defiantly order some more at a future date.	1
We love this seasoning and I always get compliments whenever I let others try my turkey jerky!	1
We love this seasoning so much I use it on frozen pizza too not just homemade.	1
We love this so much we go through a carton every two months. Autoship saves us 15% so that's even better. We've been using them with an Espressione machine since 2005.	1
We love this stuff and it's great for more than just pizzas. I first started using it when my wife had to go on a gluten free diet, and believe me, it's hard to make gluten free ANYTHING taste good, but this stuff helped a LOT!We use it on all sorts of pasta dishes, and even to spice up delivery pizza when you need that extra dash of flavor.	1
We loved the chocolate PowerBars we ordered!  They were tasty, satisfying and full of the protein we desired.  A reduction in the sugar used in the bar would be appreciated.	1
We make a lot of jerky to take with us while we are traveling for camping. We used to get it at Walmart but they don't carry it anymore. I was thrilled when I found it on  Amazon and that they had a large box of the original flavor.	1
We make ground beef jerky. These are great. takes all the guess work out . Many flavors to choose from. If you make jerky you should try these. Many friends tell us they are better than store bought jerky. We think they are	1
We make jerky all the time and like Nesco products the best.  Recently we tried the Sweet Hardwood flavor because the Pepperoni wasn't available and to our surprise, we like it better than any other flavor we've tried over the years!  Slightly sweet, and worked well both with venison and wild turkey.  I read reviews before trying something, and bought this because of the high ratings - glad we did!	1
We make Venison jerk all year round, good source of protein on ATV trips!	1
We only use Mae Ploy curry pastes, and green is definitely our favorite. We also get panang and yellow, which are also 5-star, but we just prefer the green over them. Has the best ingredient list of all the curries. This jar probably makes 20 huge batches of curry or more, each of which feed our family of three.	1
We ordered this item for our future daughter-in-law and Son. She selected this cake topper from many that Lenox offers. Upon receiving it and having a chance to look at it first hand. She was very pleased with the purchase.	1
We really like the taste and it is very easy to use.	1
We tried all 4 flavors for making venison jerky.  Each flavor is excellent and provides a burst of taste.  Each packet makes 1 lbs.	1
We use hamburger to make jerky with this. Delicious.	1
We use it on sliced Zucchini with olive oil, on the barbecue grill all the time.  Love it.	1
We use it with ground venison, but we have also used it with ground beef, and no matter what, we get rave reviews and can barely keep up with requests for venison treat packets.  We use a dehydrator, meat setting, use the Nesco piping tool, and it takes about 18 hours to make a great batch of jerky.  We turn the sticks once, pat the oil off the sticks when we turn them.  Perfecto.  The only thing that might be better is if we build a smokehouse and do it the old-fashioned way.	1
We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church.  We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes.  I like how easy they are to use.  No mess, no tamping.  I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily.	1
We use this as a base for our venison jerky.  It has the right amount of seasonings, we just add a few secret ingredients and it's perfect!!	1
We use this to season our deer jerky.  Stores well, very tasty, but not too salty. Easy instructions and reasonable price.	1
We used the orange, purple and red from this assortment.  The orange and purple tasted good but the red had a bitter after taste that my guests did not like.	1
We used this with deer meat and it's really good and tasty.  I do prefer the teriyaki seasonings to be a little bit sweeter but still tastes great.	1
We were introduced to these at Costco and love them.  Great product.	1
We were very pleased with the flavor of our jerky! We had tried others but this had the best flavor.	1
WE WILL RIDE THROUGH THE GATES OF VALHALLA SHINY AND CHROME! WITNESS ME!	1
WE WILL RIDE THROUGH THE GATES OF VALHALLA SHINY AND CHROME! WITNESS ME!	1
WE WILL RIDE THROUGH THE GATES OF VALHALLA SHINY AND CHROME! WITNESS ME!	1
Well packed,good tasting	1
Well they called few times to explain why took awhile.  They sent box full of it in smaller tins.  Which ok with me as its enough for me at one sitting.  I will buy again.	1
Well...it's cinnamon gum.  It tastes good and the flavor lasts long enough.  We have bought these for years and don't look to change.	1
Went to a restaurant on the Coast (Shaggy's) they have the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in my life. I ask  how were the chicken breast seasoned? They told me Chef Paul. I had to have the seasoning. They have it in the local grocery store, but a little pricey. Ordered it on line for  much better price	1
We've been using this for years! The blend is unique and full of flavor. Most pizza seasonings we have bought tasted predominantly of oregano, but this one brings in layers of red pepper and Parmesan cheese without being too herbal.  We use it on pizza, but we also use it on spaghetti squash, grilled veggies, etc. We don't go crazy with it, a bottle lasts a long time. It's almost impossible to find locally now, so it's good to know that it's available here.	1
We've ordered two of these boxes and I'm about to get a third.  At home, I use Illy loose grounds exclusively and do all the measuring and tamping and whatnot myself so I can feel all Barista-ey.  But in our second home, we use these pods.  They stay fresh, there's no mess, there's no fuss, and they taste great.  Get the 100% Arabica verion; it's worth the extra few bucks.	1
We've tried all the varieties of Orbit gum but always come back to the Bubblemint Sugarfree in the familiar pink package. It's a traditional flavor; nothing gimmicky, has long-lasting chewiness (I'll keep it in for about 30 minutes) and most importantly, doesn't leave my teeth feeling icky or bitty. Amazon has the best price I've found, and when you use Subscribe & Save it's even cheaper!	1
We've use for turkey beef and deer. It's yummy. My favorite is garlic pepper corn	1
We've used this brand for years to make deer jerky. We used to buy it at Walmart. This is the best we've found.	1
What A Day!!What A Lovely Day!!!	1
what a deal, what a lovely deal!	1
What a great cup of coffee. If you like a medium blend this is perfect. A local breakfast shop has this and I liked it so much I got the name from them and ordered it.	1
WHAT A LOVELY DAY TO BE SHINY AND CHROME!!!	1
What a spray! What a LOVELY SPRAY!	1
what a spray, WHAT A LOVELY SPRAY!!! It will carry you to the gates of Valhalla!!!!	1
What are all these stupid reviews about? I don't get it. This is just a great product that...What is that?Is that guy thrashing the PURE METAL OF VALHALLA whilst spewing the FLAMES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS?!OMG! It's the Glorious Army of IMMORTEN JOE!!!!!	1
What can I say ... they were sprinkles and did the trick :)	1
What can I say great tasting gum at a good price and plenty to keep me (a chain-chewer-LOL) in stock	1
What can i say. Nesco is the only one to buy. Always a quality product	1
What can I say. This product is GREAT!  Fast. Easy to use. It is like Shake and Bake. Will definitely buy more!	1
What can you say about Whoppers Malt Balls except that they are whopping good.  I received my shipment on time and in perfect condition to give out on Halloween.	1
What can you say, it's Starbucks!  I French Press this and the taste is amazing.	1
What color are the gates of Valhalla, you ask? Wilton Silver! (for the win!)	1
What could go wrong?	1
What I have come to expect, outstanding colors in both cake and frosting.	1
What is there to review/say?  Like broccoli or opera, one either loves or hates it.  I love Orbit gum.Got tired of chasing down sales at local stores and just bought it by the case on Amazon.  No regrets.	1
what use to take an hour to do l can do in an haft hours time its great	1
What's not to love? Dark chocolate + easy and fun to eat! (I sometimes pretend to hold them like cigars.)	1
When I feel a breathing episode come on, I make some of this and can avoid using stronger medicines for it.	1
When it's too cold or rainy to grill, use this on the range or in the broiler.  But turn on the fan first.	1
When they say No Stir Creamy Peanut Butter they mean no stir! Great tasting peanut butter and there is no separation.	1
When we bought our dehydrator like 4yrs ago, this spices were included & they are DELICIOUS!! we've tried a few diffrent brands but none are better than this! But now we can't find them anywhere in stores. So happy we found them here. We are ready to make our jerky now!! The only bad is with the shipping, has nothing to do w/seller. If packages are small they will be hand off to USPS so add another day to your arrival date!	1
when ya run out of jerky seasoning THIS IS THE STUFF TO BUY !!!	1

When you have no choice but to meet War Boys gone to Valhalla... There's no tastier spray you'll want to get that chrome & shinny look you're looking for.	1
Whenever I'm feeling a little congestion, I grab this tea and really do feel better. Good tasting and great for head congestion too	1
Whenever there is London broil on sale, this is the seasoning that helps to transform it into some of the best beef jerky ever.We marinate our meat in this overnight in the refrigerator.  I use a little of the 'cure' to keep any fat from turning rancid, but honestly it does not last long enough to be an issue if the kids can get at it.	1
WHICH I WILL RIDE DOWN THE HIGHEST WAY TO VALHALLA! WHAT A DAY! WHAT A LOVELY DAY! WITNESS ME! WITNESS MEEEE!!!!	1
While you're chewing it, everything's great. It's fresh, it feels good, and you wish it could go on like that forever. Then it reaches a point where it loses it's appeal completely and you spit it out in disgust, hoping to never, EVER see it again, discarding it like a used up tissue.	1
Who doesn't love gum?	1
who like chocolate.  Out of all the power bars this is the only one i like.  Way cheaper at Wal-mart 5 bars for 4 bucks.	1
Who wants to go to Valhalla with a bad taste in their mouth? This product delivers! All shiny and chrome! What a day! What a lovely day!	1
Whoppers are one of the best candies by far.  By the case straight from Hershey's is definitely the way to go.	1
Whoppers arrived exactly as described. Six 12 oz. boxes. No gazillion individually packed tiny bags, open boxes, and none arrived melted or were packed with cold packs.I couldn't be happier with my purchase.	1
Whoppers Malted Milk Balls is one of my favorite candies. I like the 1.75 oz packages because it is the perfect size snack. Huuge Saving sent  it fast and  an excellent job.	1
Wife doesn't like the smell but I can't make enough jerky for myself and friends can't wait to try other flavors	1
Wild Berry is the best flavor of powerbars, although many of the others are also good.  Amazon shipping was quick, bars were fresh.  Use subscribe 'n save to get a better price!	1
Will burn your lips/mouth. Worth.	1
Will buy again	1
will continue to use, all great flavors!	1
Wilton Flowerful Medley 6 Cell es de muy buena calidad lo recomiendo 100 % son muy buenos y son muy economicos	1
wilton makes great baking stuff	1
Wilton makes great products. Nice variety in this multi pack. I still prefer the single bottles of sprinkles. Less messy.	1
Wilton Primary Candy Color Set: I was extremely pleased with this product. I was using it for several items in my business and it performed like it was supposed to.	1
Wilton products are always the best quality, and these colors are very true and easy to work with!	1
Wilton products are great.  This is so much better than using liquid and the color is so true and bright.	1
Wilton products are the best.	1
Wilton Silver Color Mist is the only spray i use on Warboy missions.  The road to Valhalla becomes short and straight with this product. Immortan Joe recommended this to me personally.	1
Wilton sorinkles are the standard in our kitchen.	1
Wilton!! You can't go wrong with wilton products. Simply one of the best out there. These miniature set of icing are great and the colors are fab. The good thing is that if you don't bake that often the colors won't go to waste.	1
Wish I could still find this flavor in stores!	1
wish i got more for the money but i love this glitter stuff it just adds the perfect oomph to whatever your design is	1
wish it came in bigger bottle or alot more came in it but otherwise good	1
Wish you had the primary blue. the color turn out good	1
With a little futzing around, you can make your own Burger-Jerky.  It tastes great and goes fast.  Fun, and since it is from chopped/ground beef, it is easy to eat.  A+ from me.	1
With it. And its great not to salty just right.	1
With Luna bars, you either love them or hate them. I love them but in limited quantities. The chocolate raspberry flavor is by far my favorite. If you like chocolate, you will love this bar. I will eat one on the run in the morning. Keeps you full until lunch.	1
With this coffee brand you cannot go wrong!	1
With this I will ride victorious on the FURY ROAD! VALHALLA AWAITS!!!!!	1
With this product you will ride eternal, shiny, and chrome!	1

WITNESS ME!I WILL FEAST IN VALHALLA FOR I AM SHINY.	1
WITNESS THE SAVINGS!  WHO SAYS THE ROAD TO VALHALLA HAS TO BE OVERPRICED?	1
Wonderful assortment. Taste fantastic. Watch holes in top of shakers as they are large and the volume you expect is way higher when using them. I would recommend.	1
Wonderful coffee!	1
Wonderful coffee, feels super fresh when you open the vacuum packed bag	1
Wonderful Curry - love it.  This helps me to make Green Curry as good as, if not better than any Thai Food place!	1
Wonderful curry paste, throw in veggies, chicken, coconut milk and some pineapple..... good to go!  I eat it weekly at least.	1
Wonderful flavor and easy to make tasty dishes. Just be careful how much you use, it can get pretty hot!	1
Wonderful product	1
wonderful spicing for jerky	1
Wonderful stuff!!!	1
Wonderful taste, bold flavor. Highly recommend to those who love a bold flavor coffee.. Fast delivery and well packaged..Fast service.	1
Wonderful, full-body flavor!	1
Work great for bath bombs. Shiploed fast. Great quality.	1
Worked great	1
Worked great for making candy apples for my daughters birthday party.	1
Worked great for my royal icing mix to make Christmas sugar cookies.  My skills as a decorator are lacking though.  LOL	1
Worked great for what it was intended!!	1
Worked great on my cupcakes.	1
Worked great to remove the after taste of the gasoline i had to spit into the intake of my supercharger as i raced down the highway to valhalla. Provides excellent chrominess, witness!!	1
Worked great! Cupcakes turned out fantastic!	1
Worked great! Nice vibrant colors without using a ton of coloring.	1
Worked great! Spray painted Oreos to make gold coins for a party.	1
Worked great. I wasn't sure I would need it so had it as back up. Thought the icing could use a little pink tint. Instructions said use a toothpick. Thought more would be better. NOT. It turned into neon pink with 1/4 tsp. A little truly goes a long way. Next batch used the toothpick method and lovely shade light pink.	1
Worked like a charm, exactly as it should, it was fresh and the color amazing, great buy!  Much better than food coloring drops!	1
worked out great!	1
Worked perfect for making a rainbow cake!  Colored the frosting and cake mix very bright!	1
Worked perfectly with homemade fondant!	1
Worked perfectly.  Sprays on easily and did not clog.  I used it for a Transformer cake.  The red shows well and has no aftertaste to it.  My grandson loved it.	1
Worked well for my candy coating. Good color and no lumping. Since I don't do this often, the small size was perfect.	1
Worked well, no funny taste!	1
Worked, my frosting is white.	1
works as expected	1
works as well as could be expected	1
works beautifully - especially for bundt cakes & a lot easier than butter & flour	1
Works exactly like they are supposed too, colors and bright and pretty the only down side is how tiny they are and kinda wish they were easier to get out of the 'bowl'! (maybe a squeeze bottle would be alot easier)! But will be purchasing again as needed and have already recommend!!	1
works for 25th anniversary cake	1
Works great and easy to use. Gives a beautiful pearl finish to your frosted cakes.	1
Works great for ALL baked goods. My cakes, bars, brownies, muffins, etc. never ever stick when I use this. I think it works better than flour/butter in the pan.	1
Works great for my jerky	1
Works great in my espresso machine	1
works great on cupcakes!	1
Works great with white chocolate	1
Works great.  My wife loves this for baking, and I'll often use it as a general non-stick spray for pans or casserole dishes.  Just be sure to wipe down the nozzle when you're finished; the spray tends to foam a little bit around the outlet, and if you don't wipe it off it can run down the can.  Overall a great product.	1
works like a charm the only downfall is nothing, it works just like it says it would and the jerky is amazing	1
works nicely. Only need the smallest tad, it is super concentrated	1
Works perfect in chocolate.	1
Works perfect.  Made strips and pepperoni sticks,  Just wish it held more meat.	1
works perfectly, especially for my homemade rolled fondant, which usually has an ivory looking color.this gives it a perfect white.will buy it again and again	1
Works really well with chocolate, hoping they can come out with more colors.	1
Works very well, Own a lot of Wilton Products and it works just as well as all their other products. Used it to make a bundt cake, which is sometimes difficult to get out without sticking and had no trouble at all.	1
Works way better then greasing and flour	1
WORKS WELL AND TATES GREAT	1
Works well for French Macarons!	1
works well, would but again	1
Works well. No problems. The shipping was quick and efficient.  My niece uses it for preparing her beautiful attractive pastries.  It's kosher too.	1
Worth every penny.	1
Worth the money. Really functional!	1
wouldn't use anything else	1
Wow - I bought this curry based on reviews and was completely impressed.  The product is actually packaged in a plastic pouch stuffed inside the container. Not the easiest thing to open and transfer, but the concentration of paste is superior - a little goes a LONG way.  Before following directions on your recipes, test a couple of teaspoons prepared in a sauce with some rice.  Goes GREAT accompanied with a lime pickle dish !	1
Wow is what I say when I make me some Green Curry Thai tofu. I know nothing at all about Thai food but this paste makes for some tasty eats. Just be careful not to use too much because it gets hot, kids don't like the hotness so much. Also, this not be a vegan item as it has some fish head sause and shrimp with in.	1
Wow! Simply the best tasting vanilla extract I have ever used! I hope it continues to be marketed with this kind of quality. As long as it is, it will be the only liquid vanilla flavor I use.	1
Wow, great taste and easy to use. I make salmon jerky and save a bundle !	1
Yes, they're potent colors so use sparingly to start. Blends beautifully into chocolate melts.	1
You are VERY lucky if you find a gum that doesn't have its flavor vanish before you've gotten in a bunch of chews.  Orbit cinnamon has a lot of flavor and you can actually sit down while chewing.  With other gums, you don't even reach your chair before you run out of flavor and have to get up to toss it away.  Best of all, it's sugar free -- that's zero calories. Can't get better than that.	1
You can buy it for less in stores such as Joann's and Michael's but it is great for baking and I always make sure I have it in my pantry.	1
You can tell this is a high-quality gourmet vanilla.  It enhances the flavor of most everything I bake including my chocolate chip cookies.  I also make a vanilla cake with vanilla frosting and besides buying expensive vanilla beans, the Rodelle pure vanilla extract gives the best and most authentic flavor!  You won't be disappointed!	1
You can't beat all of the Magic Seasoning Blends. I use them on anything I grill or fry. It replaces just about every seasoning.	1
You get a lot of color for a small amount used, love the deep colors.	1
You have to wait until the hot weather is over to buy this product but if you love whoppers the price is right on this item.	1
You just need a small amount and it colors very well. This is exactly what I needed.	1
You will ride eternal- shiny and chrome- WITNESS ME!!!!!!!! Mediocre!!!!!!!!	1
Yummy..this thing is a must for every pizza loverThis blend is so powerful and flavory with a killer price..will be ordering more soon.. I'm officially addicted to it	1
Nesco Jerky spice is as far as I'm concerned the only one to purchase.  Love the original flavor the best.	1
Seller was very prompt in sending this product. I received it in just a couple of days.  This product is so amazing simple to use and makes the best jerky!!!  I will be ordering this product again and again!	1
I bought the spices and the jerky maker for my husband for Father's Day.  The original spices have a delicious flavor, better than any jerky I've purchased in a package.  My husband loves it, too.	1
Love the Jerky spices!  I am new at making jerky and the first batch turned out wonderful.  Will certainly reorder.	1
These are great jerky seasonings! They make it very simple to make wonderful tasting jerky fast. Only stuff we will use.	1
The flavors should suit the tastes of a whole family.. and the amount in the packages works just right for what I work with.	1
I love the flavor of these, but found that it's best dispersed if mixed in the ground beef using a food processor.  There's two (attached) packets: one with flavoring/spices and another that is curing salt.  For me, I use a little over half of the curing salt, but never the full amount.  The jerky is too salty otherwise.  I always keep the finished jerky in the fridge anyway, so I don't need as much salt in mine.	1
This is my second purchase of this product. This is the best seasoning for jerky I've found any where. I use as directed & my jerky turns out great.	1
I recommend this marinade to anyone who makes their own jerky. It's very very  flavorful and at a reasonable price	1
I have been buying this for years. It has great flavor and is a terrific snack for the kids. Try it with ground turkey. It is much leaner and the taste compared to beef in my opinion is the same. Appearance-wise, its the same as well.I just found this on Amazon so I get to take advantage of this stellar deal with my free two-day amazon prime shipping. Thanks Amazon!	1
it's a tasty seasoning set, we like all three flavors. the price is nice too. five more words. two. one.	1
bought it for my husband he loves it has made beef jerky a few times now pretty quick & easy	1
Great produce. Here in 3 days! Allot easier than looking in a super store for just a small item.WD	1
Its an easy to use product and simple directions.Taste really great and have been using it when hunting season is here. Can carry the jerky and eat all day for protein.	1
There is only one name to remember when making your own ground meat jerky and hat is Nesco.  Flavors are so distinct.	1
We have tried many different. Brands but always come back to Nesco brands. Makes the best deer jerky we have eaten.	1
Nesco offers the best jerky spice mix available. We have tried many different brands but always come back to Nesco	1
easy to make, and great hit in the office, will order again for sure highly recommend for friends and family	1
These are the best and easiest to use jerky seasonings on the market.This has four kinds - all of which are great.  You will produce better tasting jerky than any you will find pre-made.This is Great stuff!	1
I like this variety pack bc it allowed me to find my favorites. I really like the hot and original so I need to find somethin to do with this nasty pepper flavor! :/	1
The seasonings have great flavors and are easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves jerky.	1
I love this, was using the oringinal and adding spices to it until I tried this, but this is just right don't have to add anything, what a great product.	1
The spicy and regular jerky spices taste great. I add a little A-1 to the marinade for a little more flavor but it tastes good even if you just leave it like it is. Must have for a beef jerky fan who doesn't make their own marinade.	1
Awesome love it awesome it is the greatest for making awesome jerky we have made $80.00 dollars worth for $6.00 it is fantastic	1
I've been using this product for some time now and have tried others in the past, but came back to what I feel is the best on the market.	1
This is the only spice mixture my husband will use for his beef jerky. He always get rave reviews when he delivers his jerky to his friends and our family.	1
This is a good flavored jerky, I used it with strip beef and my family eats it right up.  It is delicious without being over powering.Kind of peppery which we liked, but if you don't like black pepper, you probably won't like this one.	1
tastes good I would buy it again.  good tasting in the meat.  I Need to try the other spice.  I didn't put the full packet into the meat though	1
This an excellent spice for homemade jerky, but it wasn't quite hot enough for me. My wife prefers this spice the way it is, so we made a regular batch for her and it was quite tasty.To make it even hotter we added powdered habanero peppers that we make from the garden. Man-o-man was it hot. But I loved it and my friends loved it.	1
We are jerky lovers and this seasoning is definitely the best we've come across.  The seasoning/cure packets are the perfect amount for 1 pound of ground beef.  Everyone who tries it thinks so too!	1
I use this jerky seasoning for a ground up meat jerky. Grind the meat add the jerky and dehydrate. Awesome!	1
Nesco makes a real good jerky seasoning. Between this flavor and the original, it can't be beat. Try it, you'll see	1
Great taste for a home made treat. These rubs have just enough flavor in them. Would definetly buy them again after we try to make a few rubs from home! ;)	1
We use ground turkey with this jerky spice.  Love getting this from Amazon.com because you can get this in a larger package.  The flavor is very good.  We add some hot, spicy seasoning to this original flavor sometimes and it's quite good.  It's great all on it's own, but if you want to add a little heat, that pairs well with it !  Good, tasty stuff !	1
don't be intimidated by making your own jerky - jerky! It's simple! 1st batch complete - was easy to accomplish and tasted great. Fun project to do with kids	1
I've used all of the flavors in this pack and every one of them makes really tasty jerky.Having curing salt along with flavoring gives your jerky a real 'professional' taste, and directions are easy to follow.	1
Received lots of compliments on the jerky spicing.  Good product. Will be purchasing more in the future.  Hot and Spicy seems to be the favorite.	1
This has got to be the best jerky seasoning i've ever used. Use as directed & your jerky will be incredible.	1
I got a package of this with my dehydrator and made it up. Best jerky! It was a little sweet with spice to it. 4 of my guy friends asked for more, but I was already out because it went so fast. Definitely recommend!	1
This is a great affordable way to make delicious jerky. I will continue to use this product indefinitely. I highly recommend.	1
I make Jerky and send to troops here in the states and overseas.  I love doing this and this product makes it so easy.	1
The original spice jerky works mix was a really great value and was packaged really great. Also shipped pretty fast!	1
Good Value buying it in bulk, cheaper than walmart and you get a good variety.Needs five more words here.	1
This is THE BEST jerky seasoning kit to use with hamburger jerky using the  jerky gun!  Excellent taste!  Makes your mouth water just smelling it!  Highly recommended!	1
have not tried all flavors yet but it is nice to have a selection to decide the flavor of the day.	1
I've used this product many times - purchased some for a close family member and replenished my own personal supply.	1
Nothing much to say about this, other than I own a dehydrator and I make my own jerky. This is great. The flavor is great. The price on Amazon is great. Very happy. Not my first time buying and will buy again.	1
Some of the best Jerky mix we have used and we make a lot of Jerky at Christmas time for gifts.	1
I like all the flavors, tastes way better than store bought stuff. You can use to make both steak strip jerky or the minced meat kind.	1
We tend to add our own spices/peppers, etc. to get the exact flavor we want, but the base flavor is pretty good on its own.  I like to use the Original, with about a cup of Jalapenos per pound of meat, and maybe some chipotle to adjust the flavor a bit.  A bit of BBQ sauce mixed in can be a nice change of pace, as well.	1
If you like very spicy jerky you will enjoy this product.  I enjoy spicy food and make sure that I have plenty of water available when I eat the Hot and Spicy Jerky	1
This by far is the best flavor I've had. As long as this product is around I'll continue to use.	1
I am a fan of jerky and making my own is enjoyable, adds variety and is much less expensive than buying.	1
Quick and easy review: Very good for dehydrated jerky spicing.A variety of flavors from sweet to spicy.Good value for the money.	1
couldn't find this product to use with my dehydrator for better price and in this quantity.  makes using dehydrator for dog treats a lot easier	1
The best all round flavor for basic jerky.  I also like the cure the best.  I have tried other brands, keep coming back to this one.	1
We have made a lot of Jerky and shared it widely... even sent some to SW Asia (Afghanistan and Iraq) ... it traveled well and was always appreciated. It works, is reasonably priced for what you get and well worth the time and effort. You can't ask for much more...	1
If you want to get a variety to see which jerky flavor you like for the future, then this is the way to go. To me they all tast good to great.	1
I have tried a few others but none compare to the flavor of Nesco Jerky Spice. The Original flavor is my favorite, and it so easy to use. I make it for a christmas gift to my brothers every year.	1
I love this spice mix.. Hamburger jerky is incredible. Nesco makes a great food dehydrator for fruit and meat. My wife loves the dehydrated apples from our own trees.	1
Start with a 2 lb. London Broil cut into thin strips, add two packets each of cure and seasoning, throw in a quarter cup of dark brown sugar and a couple heaping tablespoons of ground red pepper, let stand covered in the fridge overnight, dehydrate for 4 hours and you got yourself some killer, sweet & hot jerky.	1
I have used jerky works spice for years and love it.  I actually use the spice as a base for my jerky and 'doctor' it up a bit for extra flavor.  My friends all love it too.	1
I have been using jerky spice works for years.  I give it away as gifts, and everyone keeps asking for more!	1
This is a good buy.  I usually buy here because it is so hard to find in the store. Always in stock here.	1
This is so hard to find in the stores.  I found it here and the price was right for me.	1
I have not tasted the product as it was a Christmas gift but the package came just as pictured online and came rather quickly as well.	1
Very good flavor. Used it with groung beef to make awesome flat beef jerkey sticks. Will use again. And great price also!!!	1
This is a great base for making hamburger jerky. It tastes just like a Slim Jim. I've used it with both beef and turkey. I usually add about a 1/2 cup of barbeque sauce and cayenne pepper. Sometimes I add hot sauce. It always turns out perfect.	1
We have used this brand for years and just love it. We have tried many other brands as our local markets quit handling this one. Love you Amazon for always being there for us.	1
the produce was easy to use all you have to do is follow the direction that come on the package and when you go to make what you want with it comes out very well	1
When I bought my little Nesco jerky gun at Wal-Mart several years ago I purchased a box of the mixed flavoring.  The original was my family's favorite.  I have not been able to find this brand at Wal-Mart for the last couple of years.  I was thrilled to find it at Amazon, my family is going to be so happy.	1
My husband makes A LOT of jerky for fall hunting season and we go through lots of the seasoning.  Adding some cracked black pepper makes it even better.	1
This is the best jerky spice I have ever used . I have been using it for a lot of years and I only buy the original flavor. I can get it through Amazon cheaper than Nesco and highly recommend it to any one.	1
Product was great, fast shpped but upset with delivery company..  MY product was stuck in my gate and it rained on it.  the spice inside is wrapped in plastic so it was safe.	1
Have had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who's tried my jerky!  So easy to mix, can be used with ground meat or strips, and doesn't require a lot of fuss or instructions.  Haven't tried the other flavors yet, cause I'm still hooked on the original!  Highly recommend!	1
Nesco Jerky seasoning is my family's favorite brand and it taste better than any I have ever bought in a store. I have never been disappointed with any Nesco Jerky seasoning and often recommend it to family and friends. Teriyaki and Original are our favorites. The price is also very reasonable.	1
I love making deer jerky and have tried a number of different seasonings. This is my favorite by far. Nice flavor, but not too salty. Easy to kick it up a bit by adding some cayenne. Nice premeasured packets make it easy to use. Will cake up as it gets old... If it lasts that long!	1
I've tried other jerky spice, such as Oster, but Nesco is hands down the best out there.  If you're making jerky... or still deciding which one to use, look no further.  I've used this as a base too and added a twist when making my beef jerky.	1
i needed the mix in a few weeks..the mix took forever to arrive...will use it next year when i make my yearly deer jerky...	1
I've made deer and beef jerky with this stuff. It's great! I have used this as my base and added other ingredients to make awesome jerky! I have found that 48 hours in the marinade really gets the meat to where it needs to be when using beef chunks. The packets have pre-measured cure in them also. This is all you need to make some great stuff! Thanks Nesco!	1
All the varieties are very tasty whether using ground beef or with marinated whole sliced beef. The spicy flavor may be a bit too spicy for many people.	1
Have ordered this before. It is excellent. I order it for my son who makes deer jerky with it.Thank you	1
I really like using this product for our deer jerky. IT is simple to use and it gives a better taste than making your own.	1
everyone loved the spice it gives that rich jerky flavor you are looking for.easy instruction especially if you are using the nesco dehydrator	1
Excellent flavor. We use the spicy and original often in beef jerky and are very pleased with the results we've had.	1
I bought these spices locally for years but now I can't find it . Thanks Amazon . If you can find some good ground beef this stuff makes some of the best jerky around.	1
I just started making venison jerky. I decided to try this until I could figure out my own flavor. I don't need to try anything else. People at work keep coming to my desk to get more. A quart size bag doesn't last the day. It has really good flavor and easy to use	1
Love making jerky with this brand.. had to try the peppercorn flavor.. think the jerky went twice as fast.. great price n fast shipping	1
This is the only jerky spice me and my father-in-law use for our venison jerky. Very good and not too salty.	1
We've used this brand for years for deer jerky. We used to buy it at Walmart. This is the best seasoning we've used.	1
I like all the favors though cracked pepper and garlic is my favorite. My wife loves the teriyaki flavor the best.	1
I made the best deer jerky ever.  My son even suggested that I sell it because he had never had any better.	1
I had a Nesco dehydrator and love the jerky favors, particularly, Original and the black pepper garlic one. Unfortunately, the dehydrator broke after several years of good use. I just need to get another one to use the rest of the spices!	1
I get a ton of feedback and everyone wants more more more... here is a tip on how to use this effectively...I use 1 lb GOOSE/Duck to 1 lb beef....THEN I use 2/3 or 3/4 seasoning using the cracked pepper and garlic.Add one additional package of the spicy blendabout a teaspoon per 2 lbs of meat of FRESH cracked powder..dehydrate, and smoke for 20 minutesYou will have a hard time keeping people off your jerky--- this will be spicy, but not too hot where you HAVE to have a drinkenjoy	1
I've tried a lot of jerky spice, and this is the best out there! Great taste and easy to use.	1
Gave it to our son-in-law for Christmas along with the jerky gun jr. So far he has only tried the original flavor packet and was happy with the jerky it made. Can't wait to try the remaining flavors.	1
I found this product through my oldest brother and now I am addicted, I love this spice kit and if you follow directions it is perfect every time.	1

used this to make jerky for the first time..the flavor is awesome and everyone kept digging in for more..makes me feel good, when I have come up with a winner...try it!	1
Received as promised and works great.  The various mixes make a nice variety of jerky flavor choices.  Enjoy it !	1
I bought this for my son for Christmas along with a dehydrator and he loves it.  I also got some for myself	1
delicious and easy, just add to bag of meat.  will keep buying and not planning to shop around.  other flavors are good too!	1
IT IS JUST RIGHT. HAS GREAT FLAVOR. SMELLS & TASTES GOOD. I MADE IT WITH BEEF & HAMBURGER, BOTH WORKS FINE.	1
Got these to try when making jerky. My husband uses them with ground turkey. Makes the best tasting turkey jerky and really inexpensive.	1
NESCO BJ-18 This is great item and you can add any spice but it is great the way it is.	1
Tried all of the flavors and we liked them all.  The hot was very hot, so if you like hot jerky, this is the spice for you.	1
i choose this rating because it taste real good. and theres no dislike in my house. i like it because its easy to mix with my ground meat premeasured in 1lb pks.and i would recommend this product to any one thanks for asking .	1
I love these flavors for a quick hamburger/ sliced meat Jerky. The work is worth it. Better Than store bought. Enjoy!	1
Made venison jerky last night and came out great.  Was skeptical that it would be gamey, but not at all.  Shared with many co workers who normally eat venison and all agreed, great buy.	1
i really love this product.and so do the people. i share my jerky with. and i would recommend this to everyone	1
Very good, we've used these spices before. Will continue to use Nesco spices with our Nesco dehydrator. Looking forward to trying different flavors.	1
NESCO SPICES ARE THE BEST SPICES FOR FLAVOR AND PRICE. I'VE USED A LOT OF JERKY SPICES AND RECIPES OVER THE YEARS MAKING DEER JERKY, AND THEIR RECIPE IS ACCURATE FOR FLAVOR FOR WHAT THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TELL YOU. SOME COMPANIES LIKE HI- MOUNTAIN WILL TELL YOU HOW MANY POUNDS THEIR JERKY WILL FLAVOR AND THEY'RE WAY OFF. NESCO 1 LB. PACKETS TRULY FLAVOR A 1LB. AMOUNT OF MEAT.  - C.C.	1
I've used this spice to make deer jerky for years.  Its one of the best that I have tried.  I highly recommend it.	1
This seasoning/curing mix makes great tasting home made jerky. Better than store bought, and a LOT cheaper. I have always preferred the original flavored store bought jerky, so that is the only flavor I use of this. I am sure all their flavors are really good, but I can't eat anything very spicy due to acid reflux problems. If you haven't yet, you should really try this seasoning and cure.	1
These are quick and easy packets to use.  The flavors are all great.  My favorite is the hot and spicy.  I use them with ground hamburger and my dehydrator to make beef jerky and they turn out great.	1
The flavors are great.  I gave it to my dad for fathers day and he's been making jerky ever since.  The whole family loves the taste.	1
This is the best spice I have used for jerky! Wonderful flavor and great price! Very easy to use also.	1
This is th first tome I have tried this brand and I am glad I did. Very good flavor and at a great price.	1
We love jerky and this makes the best seasoning for deer jerky.  We have tried many other flavors but the Original is the best.	1
We love jerky and this makes the best seasoning for deer jerky.  We have tried many other flavors but the Original is the best.	1
I make a lot of wild game jerk and this is the best product I have found so far too accomplish the task of great tasting jerky.	1
This piping gel was very easy to work with and had my cake looking marvelous! It was easy to change its colors too.	1
I had to have this for my cake class at Hobby Lobby , It worked good for outlining and it doesnt take much	1
Perfect package size with a product that has a great consistency and texture. Perfect for all decorating uses. Would buy again.	1
Great gel, came quickly, great price, works as expected. I use it to stabilize whipped cream and pipe on cakes.	1
Great  packaging and good item,will buy again next time:)	1
love this stuff and use it to create water droplets and fountains etc	1
Worked very well for what i needed it for	1
Very good product.  Has many uses. I use it to make buttercream icing less stiff,make consistency softer. Can also be use to stop cake from crumbs coming through when icing,also before applying fonfant. It hrlps fondant adhere to cake.  Haven't used it yet for last two applications but will try it and plan to buy more.	1
never used the gel before and it worked great!  be aware that it is super sticky, and since it is clear you may not realize that it has dripped somewhere.	1
Piping gel was sent to  very fast, in good condition, great price. I have bought it at our store here and it is costly. I would definitely buy again! Thank you	1
Used this for a decorating a cake and cake topper and it really work wonderful. I also  used very little, so it goes a long way.	1
I'm really happy with my purchase. I look every where for it and couldn't find it none of the stores I went to had it	1
i put some blue on it to make the perfect sea for a boat i made as a cake beautiful thanks	1
Used it it to adhere fondant to a cake.  Worked well and didn't affect the flavor of the cake at all.	1
An excellent product. It's so nice to use with fondant. I recommended it. An excellent brand. Not expensive. I love it.	1
I used the clear piping gel to adhear sugar crystals to a wedding cake and it worked great!  Very Happy with it for this use.  Simply brush on the piping gel with a soft paint brush over the already crusted buttercream icing...sprinkle with sugar crystals.....DONE!	1
This is by far the best coffee I've ever tasted.  I drink coffee black so I'm a comparison shopper for gourmet beans.  While it is expensive, you can taste the difference.  It definitely has a woodsy flavor with no aftertaste.  It's pure.Although I wouldn't drink it every day - it's an awesome treat and highly recommended for those that can appreciate it.	1
Short of visiting a coffee plantation on Kona, this is the best.Be sure to read the suggestions included by the manufacturer.Try it in a vacuum brewer for a real treat!	1
I received  a box as a gift and was surprised by the  flavor, medium-bodied and smooth. No bitterness, this coffee was well balanced and well, comforting :) Enjoyable on a nice sunny morning but equally satisfying on a rainy day. A great gift for coffee connoisseurs!	1
I give these out to my friends and family members who love the taste of 100% pure Kona Coffee. The 2oz sampler bags offer a taste of each roasting profile. The sampler box looks great and makes for a great gift. If you love Kona coffee, don't forget to buy a box for yourself!	1
Thank you Aloha Island Coffee for some awesome tasting coffee.  This is what I've been looking for.  I'm very picky about my coffee tastes, as I enjoy coffee and especially 100% Kona Coffee.  I have one more bag to sample and I can't wait to order more in the larger bags.  Mahalo	1
The Diamond II is a very rich and strong coffee.  A bit pricey but worth every penny.  If you don't want to fork out the money for this, the Gold blend is nearly as good at a much lower price point.	1
This purchase was received as described,  good quality, well packaged, very timely, and I would purchase from this seller again!	1
My husband and I agree; this is the best coffee we have ever had!Delicate and lovely flavor, low acidity, and no aftertaste.  It is more expensive than other coffee, to be sure, but it is also considerably better.	1
My husband received a cannister of these peanuts for Christmas 2 years ago and now wants only this brand/kind.  Great quality & great price.  Will order again & again.	1
If you have only eaten grocery store peanuts or planters and thought all peanuts are the same , think again.  This peanuts are a stop above in freshness and flavor and have just the right amount of salt.  Once you try them, you will never buy just peanuts again. Perfect for parties and snacks. Great hostess gift or for friends and neighbors.	1
These peanuts are the best tasting that I have experienced thus far.	1
These are the best peanuts I have ever had	1
Periodically purchase these.  They are the best peanuts I've found.  They are not dry roasted, but not oily and only very lightly salted.	1
These peanuts taste great, have a nice crunch to them, and are salted just right.  Will buy more in the future.	1
These are some of the best peanuts we have ever eaten! We are big fans of how crunchy but not oily these peanuts are. We buy a can about every 10 days so we don't run out!	1
Best peanuts around.  Worth the extra $ for quality taste.	1
Killer peanuts. Huge size, great taste, lightly salted. We like The Peanut Shop and Costco Kirkland Peanuts. In a grocery store trip pinch, Planter's Dry Roasted. These are better than all.	1
Love these peanuts. Haven't found any better ones.	1
As delicious as a Virginia peanut can get.  ALL GONE!	1
These are awesome!  Salted perfectly, crunchy as heck, and quite addictive!  I am about to order some more, in fact, after I write this review.  Look no further if you are seeking quality Virginia peanuts.	1
When I bought the 40 oz can I was not sure how much I was getting. But when you see the can, and it is very big, it is a very good deal. Dont compare cost per oz with planters. Ferdie's peanuts are just so superior and quality matters much more  than quantity. This is my first  time to try VA peanuts and I will try other brands but for now is the easily the best peanuts I have eaten and will set the standard of  excellence for another brands I try in the future.	1
Best peanuts I have had. Large & crunchy. My whole family is addicted to them.	1
Large peanuts. Very tasty. Hard to stop eating them.	1
These peanuts are large, crunchy, flavorful and very lightly salted. We are addicted to them and I'm not a peanut fan.	1
These are out favorite brand of peanuts! Delivery was fast!	1
These are large, beautiful, delicious peanuts! Non-GMO and roasted in peanut oil, lightly salted. We love them!	1
Good crunchy peanuts.	1
Great product!  Fresh taste!  Regular purchaser since finding them!	1
I have been looking for peanuts that don't have preservatives or other garbage on them.  Several months ago I found peanuts from Virginia (Parker's Peanuts) in the local store and decided to try them and we loved them.  Just peanuts and salt.  No chemicals or preservatives.  I had no idea Virginia peanuts were so amazing.  Best peanuts we ever had.  They ran out of the Parker's so I decided to try this brand and these are also fantastic!  Highly recommend.	1
These are the best salted peanuts I have ever eaten!	1
Excellent peanuts. Very fresh. They have a crunch to them that most do not. Several people who have tried them do not like the crunch.	1
Best peanuts I've tasted in 50 years. We still have a few left but will be reordering soon. The container keeps them nice and fresh.	1
real crunchy and delicious	1
My quest for the perfect peanut is over. After 3 orders from Amazon and a few purchases from stores in an effort to find the best Virginia peanut, my quest is over. Feridies peanuts are crunchy, very large, perfectly salted and full of great peanut taste. There is a mile of distance between this one and number 2.	1
Good crunchy large fresh peanuts.	1
Wonderful peanuts.  We can't stop eating them.	1
Best bang for your buck. Delicious extra large peanuts for a decent price.	1
The flavor of these peanuts are amazing!! Highly recommend.	1
Really fresh and crispy...not overly salty and good bang for your buck. You'll never go back to Planter's.	1
best crunchy peanuts I have found.	1
All recipients of these peanuts we gave as gifts raved that they were the best they had ever had!!	1
Great peanuts! They are so crunchy and delicious. Nothing like what you get in the supermarket.	1
great peanuts but holy crap 40 oz is a lot	1
This was hilarious, I didn't pay attention to the size online. They are huge. And amazing. They are a dry peanut, so very crunchy - PERFECT for what I wanted. I keep them at work for my friends that have medical issues or forget to eat. They're universally loved.	1
These are some of the best Virginia Peanuts on the market. The only problem is that it is hard not to eat them non-stop.	1
These aren't just good, they're GREAT! Wanted something besides dry roasted grocery store type and read these reviews and decided to try them. Really good and I'm eating them as I type this. YUM!!!	1
The best available. Very crisp. Well salted	1
Order these peanuts on a regular basis. So good that they disappear very quickly in my house.	1
Great peanuts.  Large, crunchy, and just the right amount of whole nuts.	1
We really like these peanuts and Thank you.	1
So very yummy and salty!  Great size!	1
Always fresh and crunchy. The only Peanut we use with our Candy Corn and Peanut mix. Love you guys.	1
The real thing . . . they came crunchy and extremely fresh. Ordered a second can as the first was so yummy.	1
Take it from a 59 year old peanut connoisseur, these are well worth the price!  Lightly roasted for a lighter peanut taste so if you like darker roasted, these are not for you.  Perfectly salted, consistent nut size, crunch and flavor. I ordered 2 nine oz cans to try them a week ago.  My tiny spouse loved them too!  So both cans are gone.  I sure hope these are consistent batch to batch.  Just ordered a 40 oz can which is the best value.	1
If you haven't had Virginia Peanuts you are missing out. Had my 1st Virginia Peanuts 2 years ago and what a treat. These area a good buy and i would recommend them to anyone and will buy again.	1
The biggest peanuts ever and so so crunchy. Not too salty either	1
I cannot express vehemently enough how yummy these peanuts are!  They are so well salted, with some kind of delicate, finely ground salt, that when I crave a salty snack these are my go to.  The peanuts are fat and almost sweet, they are so very flavorful.  I've trued many brands of peanuts before, but I can't get enough of these.  I buy them over and over and have turned other peopke on to how wonderful they are.	1
Best peanuts, ever!  Never run out in my house.	1
There are not enough stars to accurately describe how perfect these peanuts are. To start with they are a bigger, more flavorful, superior peanut. Then, the technique they use to cook the nuts ( think they are blanched then roasted) is very unique. The result is a super flavorful crunchy peanut. And I mean really crunchy good!! We order these consistently and when guests come over they rave about them. These are the finest!!	1
These are delicious, salted just right and crunchy.	1
Love the Freidies brand of peanuts.  Been buying them for a while	1
These are the most amazing peanuts. We normally don't eat a lot of nuts but I bought a small pack of these to snack on and our family and friends are all hooked. These are not your average peanuts. They are crisp and clean with a serious crunch. The small packets are quite expensive so I would recommend the large can. Keep the foil top attached and the peanuts will stay crisp for a long time.	1
You will never eat Planter's again after having these!	1
Best peanuts ever!  Will certainly buy again.	1
Best peanuts by far I have ever eaten.	1
too good for words! crunchy and fresh every time.	1
These are the highest quality best tasting peanuts on the planet. If you like snaking on peanuts you won't be sorry you bought these.	1
Gave as a gift. Very tasty and thoroughly enjoyed	1
Have bought these a couple times now. Big and crunchy and delicious.	1
These peanuts live up to their reputation! Big, crunchy peanuts with an awesome flavor. I bought the large tin for Christmas, but now that my family has gotten a hold of the can, it may not last until then.	1
Love these. Crunchy, tasty, wonderful.	1
These are so good. When my local natural market ran out of this flavor from this brand, I came here. Found this ginormous tub, and that works better for us than the little pouches.	1
These are the old-fashioned style of Va. peanuts, lightly roasted, large and full of flavor.  If you like brown roasted Planters, don't buy these.  And don't leave negative feedback if you buy these and they aren't roasted as much as you like.  They are not supposed to be.  These are perfect, the way Williamsburg and other Va. peanuts used to be before they went national and overroasted their peanuts to sell to the Planters buyers.	1
Best peanuts in the WORLD!! I highly recommend this product.	1
A gift for someone else, and they loved the nuts.	1
sent as gift = happy recipient	1
Great.  Delivered well before stated delivery time.	1
I was looking for GMO peanuts and Feridies fit the bill. The fact that they are perfectly roasted and taste better than The Peanut Shop or other brands of Virginia peanuts is a bonus. Highly recommend!	1
These are the best!	1
Gave this as a Christmas present for my husband but the whole family loved them. Super fresh, very tasty nothing like the peanuts you buy at the store.	1
We had some at Thanksgiving and my wife loved them.	1
Very good large, crunchy, Virginia`s!!	1
Really good,  a bit pricey but I will buy again.	1
Super sized and super crunchy with a ton of flavor. Another quality product I would buy over and over.	1
EVERYBODY LOVES THESE PEANUTS...SAVING ONE CAN FOR CHRISTMAS BAKING	1
Best peanut you'll ever have!	1
Just trying to find the best Peanuts I could and happened upon these and I have to say they are great I will order my second can as soon as I finish this review. Excellent product and it is a huge can. I mean you can stick your fist into it.	1
These peanuts have literally changed the way I snack.  They are so much better than Planters that I won't even eat a Planters peanut anymore. I am ruined for all other peanuts.  I just ordered several more containers so I can always serve them at parties.  These are the peanuts you want representing your hostess skills.	1
The very best peanuts are Virginia peanuts. They are large and lightly slated. They are absolutely delicious. What a healthy snack.	1
I am not that crazy about peanuts.  BUT, Feridies is the exception.  I recently had house guests visiting from Virginia.  They arrived with a can of these peanuts. Wow!  They were delicious. I finished off the can and went straight to Amazon to see if I could order more.  I am now working my way through a 40 oz can.  Feridies, you have a new fan in California, so good!	1
Nothing more to say than the peanuts were absolutely great.  Bought them for my husband, and we both enjoyed them thoroughly.  Will more than likely buy again sometime.	1
These are so crunchy.  We love them.  They are great eaten out of hand but also in my cooking.  Not the normal peanut you'd find in stores.	1
These are AWESOME NUTS! I get them every year and often send them to family. They make great gifts for those NUTS in your bunch!	1
My favorite peanuts. I love them.  Wish I could have them all the time!!! This is stupid that I have to add more words.	1
Great product!  Right amount of salt, oil, consistency and crunch.  Our family's favorite peanut by far!  If you want terrific snack look no further than right here.	1
Best peanuts I have ever had. Much better than Planters nuts, very fresh and very crunchy. I do not know how they make or grow these nuts, but they are worth the extra money you will pay for them.	1
This indeed is the best.View tips and guidelines | 15 more words requiredView tips and guidelines | 15 more words required	1
We have tried most of the Virginia peanuts out there and my wife and I agree that these are the best available. They are a perfect match of crunchiness and salt and it's hard not to eat just a handful of them. They're great when watching any type of sports or at any kind of party. You won't be disappointed!	1
I always send See's as a gift to relatives!  They are worth the extra shipping cost and have always arrived in perfect condition.	1
I really enjoy sending things online. This purchase was a gift so I really think that there should have been available a gift card to send with it. I had to mail a card separate from this purchase.	1
Was a hit for Valentines Day!	1
Delicious as usual.	1
received on time and taste great.	1
Great quality a family favorite for generations.	1
Superb chocolates, easily superior to over-priced alternatives. No reason to look further, Folks.	1
See's candy is the best.  It's one of the things most missed when we moved to KY.  Online shopping is a wonderful thing.	1
my favorite  chocolates and right on time! highly recommend!	1
Who don't like See's candy.	1
Love Sees candy. Easy to order. Was a gift and our friend was delighted with the present.	1
I did not appreciate receiving a squashed a nd	1
This was a gift.  The recipient loved it.  My favorite candy gift to give.	1
I have been eating See's for many years.  I like these  chocolates because they use good ingredients which tastebexcellen.	1
Best chocolate in the world. It is rich and creamy and worth the money spent	1
Good chocolate, delivered on time	1
Arrived in good condition.  It was a gift and recipient enjoyed the candy and shared it with friends.  I'm a big fan of See's candy.  Very tasty.  I love the chocolate flavors and the fillings are always good.  I even eat the coconut one; I don't usually like coconut.	1
Fast order!!  Delicious candy!!	1
You can't miss with See's candy! I bought a box for my daughter in Colorado before leaving California but her dogs got into it and ate all of it. (Big dogs so they were fine.) I ordered another box through Amazon so she wouldn't be disappointed.	1
Bought the candy as a birthday gift for my wife, who grew up in CA where See's was her favorite candy. She was delighted with them, and said they were every bit as good as she remembered.  She is savoring every piece ! Candy arrived on time, and was as fresh and delicious as expected.	1
my friends favorite candy she loved it	1
I figure if you're ordering See's Candy you've had them before.  Nothing else to say.  Delicious.	1
It was a Christmas gift for friend. See's chocolates are delicious! Rich and creamy chocolate.	1
Gift for my mother now in Florida and she loved them!  There is nothing that compares to See's Candies!	1
I saw this on Celebrity Apprentice, they are GREAT. I have not found one that I don't like. I will order again.	1
They are sooooo delicious.	1
The flavor is magnificent and the assortment is great.  A little pricey, but worth the cost.	1
See Candy is great	1
Sent to relatives who previously lived in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It brought back pleasant memories of my childhood......a box of See's candy was a special gift!	1
Great Chocolates that only Californians use to know about.  	1
Delicious!  Great candy!  Arrived on time and in good condition.	1
Can't go wrong with See's chocolates. Yum!	1
Sees candy cures depression and speeds healing of any illness !!	1
See's candy is consistently quality with excellent taste.  We know what it will be and feel safe and willing to serve it to guests as well.It is a favorite of ours.	1
This is by far my favorite candy ever. The quality is unsurpassed and I order it every Christmas for my special friends and family.	1
This box of candies was sent to my oral surgeon clinic here in Maine. They all love it a lot. Since I am original fromCalifornia I always adored See's Candies.	1
Great Chocolates	1
The post office let me down, but the See's candy made up for it.	1
Had to call sees's candies as the candy was white and old. Sees already is replacing.	1
Can always count on 5 star quality on these fantastic candies.  A great gift!	1
See's chocolates are a family tradition and they are fabulous!!!	1
Ordered for my 93 yr. old mother in law who used to work for See's Candies in her younger days.  It was shipped to her and was a big hit for her birthday.  I am so glad we did that because she went to her reward in May and we all miss her very much.	1
I was very pleased with the service.  Thank you.  IM	1
Timely shipping, as described, would purchase again.	1
The best box of candy around in my opinion.	1
See's chocolates are a classic. Every flavor combination they make is tasty, and the chocolate coatings are creamy and luscious. Chocolate covered marzipan will always be my favorite.	1
The best candy you can buy, cost ore but well worth it. Try the peanut brittle, even if, you don't like peanut brittle, you will be wanting more.	1
Yum and it arrived quickly too.  I loved the fact that it was wrapped for Christmas. Thank you	1
See's is by FAR he best candies EVER.  My grandmother started bringing us this candy probably 50 years ago and has been treasured ever since.  i have been known to hide it in my underware drawer for safe keeping!!!!  The people that receive it from me know they are special!	1
Friend was very happy with gift, candy is very good. Thankyou	1
Love See's Candies!	1
See's is the very Best candy.	1
The box wasn't big enough to satisfy my families demonic lust for fatty chocolates. Still, it was great while it lasted.....for 3 days.	1
This is See's Chocolates. If you have never had See's then you don't know what you are missing. There is a reason I would order a box of Chocolate from literally across the country. NO OTHER CHOCOLATE CAN COMPARE TO THIS. It is in a world of its own.	1
If you love See's Chocolates, then you'll love this variety pack.  It offers milk and dark chocolates, nuts, truffles, toffee - let's just say that it looks like See's picked their favorites and put them in this variety pack.  We enjoyed these as a new Easter tradition :)	1
almost nothing better than See's.  This chocolate is so yummy and the price is right for this product right here on Amazon.  Especially if you are a Prime Amazon member and can find it right here.  So easy.  Then just sit back and wait for the mailman.	1
What can I say - it's See's candy and they haven't changed in all these years - except for the PRICE!  This is a LOT of money to pay for a box of chocolates!  So - you had better love the person you are buying it for (including yourself) to want to spend that much on a single layer box.  They're good - but once a year is enough unless it's someone VERY special!	1
I ordered two boxes of candy for my elderly mother for Xmas. Both boxes arrived in perfect condition, in a super fast period and the candies made her day. thank you	1
Bought this for a hostess gift for a dear friend from California, where See's is the go-to brand for chocolate lovers. They've been appearing at our holiday dessert table in my family for sixty years, I think; they're better to my taste than Teuscher or Godiva (by far) and much less expensive, but still clearly premium chocolates.	1
This was purchased as a gift and it was very well-received. I appreciate the consistency of the taste of See's Candies. You always know what you're going to get.	1
Sees really is good chocolate...they have several varieties, or you can customize a box of your favorites..very good product!  They have some Easter specials too.	1
Ordered these for a gift. Not all the See's chocolates had an option for gift wrapping but these did so that's what we went with. While I can't comment on the freshness of the product since we'll never see them they shipping was super quick. Very glad it made it there sooner rather than later. Was supposed to arrive on the 17th via PRIME but actually arrived on the 14th... how this is possible I'm not sure. Did they wrap it up and hand deliver it? lol	1
We ordered these for our Valentines Day gift to our children.  Every one was thrilled over the large box and spaced the consumption out over several weeks.  From the oldest to the youngest there was great admiration of the excellent taste in every chocolate.  Only bought these for a special occasion -- a little pricey for every day purchases.	1
Sees has wonderful candy. So worth cheating on your diet for. If you get this item for a gift, don't share it. Hide it from every body else it is too good.	1
See's is the best!!!!!!!!!! This was a gift for my daughter and her friend, who live in Florida. No see's store there, so they really appreciate it!!!!!!	1
Delicious!  Hard to eat just one! Everyone I give it to is thrilled. When family visits they bring me a box.  It just makes their visit even sweeter.	1
This is always the perfect gift to say Happy Birthday,or Thank You.  My sister lives on the east coast andshe considers this the ultimate treat from me.We all Love Sees Candies.  They now even have asugar-free bar that is delicious.	1
No other chocolates even come close to the taste and quality of See's Chocolates. I never buy any other brand.	1
This is one of the best chocolates I have ever had , and since they don't have a store locally this is the only place I can get it :)	1
they were really great and they came in excellent condition and i was a little worried with the heat that we have been having back here but it was in a cool chest and the candy did not melt and they had all the great taste of the candies that you get in the store. and the shipping was great too.	1
The quality, presentation and taste of See's is top notch. We highly recommend the two pound box as a gift. The assortment is a nice mix and there's something for everyone's taste.	1
Great for making a flavorful and refreshing Iced Tea or hot tea with cream and sugar.  Super Yumm! The scent alone will draw you in.  I like to mix a couple of these Apricot Tea bags with a couple of bags of simple black tea or Oolong tea for a mix and match unique flavor. Try sweetening with honey for a tasty treat!	1
Ashby tea does itself proud like it always does. You can't get a beter tea than Ashby's.	1
It's a little pricey but good to the last drop.  Will continue to purchase this tea.  Love Love Love it!!!!!	1
Always good, rich, smooth. :)	1
This a great black tea. As good as some much more pricey. I was a little concerned when I opened the package. It wasn't as fragrant as I'm used to but the taste proved me wrong.	1
High quality loose leaf traditional English Breakfast tea. The bag works well for storage. It all comes at a hard to achieve practical value price point.	1
I love the Harney & Sons loose teas - always fragrant and a lovely clear cup of soothing tea.  The bag is sturdy enough to keep the tea fresh for quite some time (although I drink it every day so don't need to store it very long :-)	1
This is a great tea if you enjoy a strong black tea. I drink it w?o milk or sugar and it is great.	1
This tea is simply the best black tea I ever have had. Not much on foo foo descriptions but this honestly has wonderful after tastes and is very nuanced. I started with 4 oz now am ordering 2 lbs at a time. I, needless to say, highly recommend this tea. If you like Black tea you just will be tickled with this one.	1
I was looking for a good tea for making iced tea. Too many teas seem to lose all character when you chill them. I hot brew this tea, then chill it in the refrigerator. It always produces a delicious brew that retains its character when chilled, and is never bitter. If you're looking for the perfect glass of iced tea, this is the tea to use.	1
The tea is great. It's a local company. I enjoy this rich bodied tea every morning.	1
Can't go wrong with harney tea!	1
This is my favorite tea.  You have to check the Harney Website however because sometimes you do better buying it through them	1
Great Product, Great Price , and Great Service,couldn't ask for more!	1
This is good honest tea.	1
I'm a big fan of English breakfast tea, and this tea tastes amazing!!!	1
This tea has excellent flavor.	1
Good for any time	1
I was frustrated with trying to find good loose leaf tea at a good price in stores. This tea is wonderful and exceeds my expectations for freshness, taste and price.	1
Great high quality Keemun tea. Although obviously not as high grade as Keemun Mao Feng or other varieties, this Keemun is more of an everyday tea. It posses that distinctive flavor that makes Keemun what it is but on a lighter note. I would definately recommend Harney and Sons English Breakfast seeing as I went through 16 ounces of it MUCH faster than I expected to.	1
I love this tea probably because of its mild flavor	1
Great Blend!!! Does the trick!!!	1
I gave up coffee a few years ago and had been looking for a good morning tea that I can take to work and give me a good wake up kick of caffeine.  this english breakfast tea has such a great taste to it and is of such a high quality. I can't recommend it highly enough. absolutely love this tea.	1
Love this brand of English Breakfast tea.  Happy to see I can buy it on Amazon and get free shipping.	1
Great tea and fast delivery.	1
Great deal for some great tea! Packaging is decent but I suggest transferring it to a larger airtight tin. It was fresh and fragrant upon delivery and will definitely be getting another bag when this supply runs low. Recommend for those who consume tea on a frequent basis.	1
I have bought 4 (or so) pounds of this tea via Amazon. I am not into fashionably flavored teas, either.I like tea flavored tea.And since I don't add anything like milk/cream/sugar, I get to taste the tea the way it's supposed to be tasted. I've had a cup of this tea every morning for a few years now, and I can honestly sa yI have no reason to switch. I started out by ordering a sampler (they sell them) of smaller bags, and although there is a wide selection, the simplest is always the best.	1
My everyday gotta-have-it coffee.  Harney and Sons is great quality tea, and the English Breakfast is a terrific blend.	1
The most delicious tea!  Quick delivery	1
I really like the flavor of this tea. Best I've ever had.	1
Not as strong as Irish Breakfast tea but none the less.	1
Wonderful, rich, loose breakfast tea.  I use it every morning!	1
If you are an Earl Grey Connoisseur, this tea is for you! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Heave with bergamot.	1
Great  deal on excellent tea	1
I am a repeat customer. Wonderful flavor. Great price.	1
I love Earl Grey, but I had never had this good anywhere. The flavor is full bodied and has an amazing aroma. And the loose leaf has a much better flavor than any bag tea.	1
Ahhh bergamont the real thing and big beautiful loose leaves. Am a cheapster myself and in this case that doesn't work. I will pay if it's actually quality and this is it if you are a tea lover.	1
I use this product with my Keurig reusable k-cups as I couldn't find an Earl Grey tea worth drinking with the regular k-cups. This one does the job.	1
I discovered this tea over 10 years ago and I love it!  It is the best Earl Grey tea I know of.	1
If you like Earl Grey tea, you'll find no better than Harney & Son's blends. But once you've tried the Earl Grey Supreme you won't be able to live without it. All others will seem washed out by comparison.	1
great flavor.  my only problem is how much to use.  I have slowly perfected the amount.  You don't need much.  A little goes a long way. Great flavor and great quality	1
Wife loves it! Good cups but less Bergamont than we expected.	1
This is the most clear, refreshing Earl Grey tea I've ever made. I will definitely buy more when I've used up this sack.	1
It's some of the best tea I've ever tasted.  Very smooth with little to no harshness or bitterness, even as I get to the bottom, overstepped portion of the French Press I use for loose tea.  Warning, it will spoil you for the non-supreme version of this product and all bagged Earl Greys will become bland dissapointments hereafter.	1
My favorite Earl Grey, and more economical in this large loose tea container than in the sachets.	1
Delicious tea! Exceptionally aromatic too.	1
i really like ALL of the 'harney & sons' loose teas!  i don't think you can go wrong with any of them!	1
We love Harney & Sons tea. First time buying via Amazon. High quality tea and far superior to packaged teas you find at the grocery store.	1
Wonderful flavor as well as great quality tea leaves! The Earl Grey Supreme Tea is now my favorite tea!!	1
By far my favorite Earl Grey and I just love this bulk pack so much better than buying the smaller tins.	1
Delicious, black, dark, tea.The best you can taste. Get your hands on this bag specifically. You will not regret it. Give it as a gift, or be spoiled and keep it all to yourself.	1
I buy one of these a month, consistent quality	1
Delicious, stays fresh in the packaging, and a wonderful scent of bergamot.  It's a fairly strong scent, intoxicating to me.  I am from Europe originally and love tea, Earl Grey being my favorite, and this did not disappoint.  This is my go-to tea.  I highly recommend.  I make ice tea out of this also.	1
My daughter gave me this tea one Mothers Day and I have not bought any other brand since.  Its excellent, the flavor is like no other and their customer service is excellent.  All their products come perfectly packed and their sets are beautiful.  Highly recommend all their teas	1
Excellent Earl Grey!	1
Smooth taste. Energizing as a morning drink.	1
Simply marvelous Earl Grey! So happy I can get it by the pound now! Same exact blend as in the small tin. I just refill mine so it looks more attractive and takes up less counter space. Price is reasonable and shipping was fast. I will order again!	1
Product is an excellent loose leaf decaf tea.  I cannot tell the difference in taste.  Use in auto tea brewer.	1
Great as hot or cold tea. I heat water to boiling, turn it off add the tea into the kettle and let the leaves soak all day. Strain and chill--the best ever.	1
Harney and Sons know from tea. I gave this as a gift to a friend, and yep, she was delighted with the flavor and freshness.	1
I bought this after having been served Thai iced tea with no cream in a restaurant, and really, really liking it. So, I did some digging and discovered the base for Thai ice tea is just Ceylon tea. But, I'm pregnant, so I've been trying to avoid caffeine. So...decaf Ceylon! I am super happy with this purchase. It is by far the best decaf tea I've ever had. The flavor is very close to the caffeinated version, especially when put on ice.	1
WE ARE FROM SRI LANKA ( CEYLON BEFORE ) AND THIS IS GOOD TEA.	1
Best decaf tea. Hard to find loose decaf. Expensive, but worth it.	1
Our pet starling needed tannin added to her diet, but she didn't need caffeine.  A little decaf black tea blended into her food (dry), does the trick.  Just what the veterinarian ordered.  High tea!	1
My favorite tea!!!!!	1
Another great tea for my collection.	1
Bought this tea for my wife who only drinks decaf black tea of which there are limited choices. She absolutely loves this tea and has since ordered a larger quantity	1
A wonderful quality tea.	1
Arrived quickly and is tasty.  Not as strong as I would like, but guess that goes with being decaffienated.	1
Buy this for my wife, she is not a tea drinker but she loves this tea.  This is my second tin.  Not a big decaf tea drinker myself, so I've only had it a couple of times, it is very smooth and aromatic.  You can over brew it a bit before it goes bitter but it is much better when following the brewing instructions on the tin.	1
This is an excellant decaf tea, not best but certainly top shelf.	1
This tea is perfect with cream and won't keep you up at night!  I would absolutely buy it another time.	1
It seems difficult to find a full flavored decaf tea.  I discovered Harney & Sons t my local Duch Bros... Had to order some online.	1
I was pleasantly surprised by the strong taste of this, full bud Chamomile tastes so different from the typical bagged cut pieces.	1
I thought I hated earl grey tea...  this tea has changed my mind!  This is one of my top 5 for sure.	1
Earl grey supreme from Harney and Sons will knock your socks off.  This is my go to tea.  The very best there is.	1
Easy to prepare great taste. Convient to store tin.  You don't need a lot of tea to make a mug full	1
Great product for a great price. If you love Earl Grey, you cant go wrong with this one.	1
Taste great wish it was a bigger container	1
Fragrent bouquet, with lovely flavor. This is my favorite Earl Grey blend!	1
Really good; more mellow than other earl grey teas that I've tasted.	1
A gift for my mother and she loves it!  Wants me to buy her more!	1
I bought several Harney & Sons teas when I ordered. This blend was easily my favorite and the tea that disappeared the quickest. This is a delicious Earl Grey tea, full bodied, with the pronounced Bergamot richness inherent in great Earl Grey teas. I find Harney & Sons to be a superior purveyor of teas and I have tried many of their varieties and blends. All have been excellent, with the Earl Grey being my favorite.	1
I love this tea. Such high quality tea.	1
Hubby drinks tea quite a bit of treatment in winter.  He thought  it has a good flavor and full bodied. Made tons of tea this year, fast shipping and handling.  Packaged well, and seller easy to work with.	1
Very nice tea, a little creamy and over all a really great flavor and aroma. Will likely buy again.	1
My favorite tea!  Best Earl Grey I've ever had!	1
Supreme to the taste buds (no pun intended), and great to blend with other teas (such as Harney and Sons Paris or Jasmine). A favorite for almost every morning.	1
One of my favorite Earl Grey teas especially for the price!	1
It is much better then their Earl Grey	1
What a fantastic tea.  This is a really intense, full bodied tea.  If you like Earl Grey, you will love this tea.	1
Outstanding Earl Grey tea. The standard just about that all should go by. The fragrance is unreal. You will not regret this buy.	1
One of my favorite Earl Greys.	1
One of the great Earl Grey teas...as simple as that...I've had one or two others that are as good, none better.when you get it right, not much else to say	1
This is definitely one of my favorite earl grey's ever, I like it a little better than twinnings or amad tea...	1
Not just my favorite EG but my all-time favorite tea.	1
Excellent quality, fast shipping.	1
If you like a traditional earl gray tea this tea will blow your mind! The beautiful flavors couple with the great aroma to make this my go to tea every day.  The robust bergamot flavor and  subtle aroma of floral and citrus leave me coming back for more.	1
Bought for my husband as he loves earl grey. Once you go supreme other greys just don't measure up.	1
Best priced and flavored earl grey available	1
Excellent, flavorful Earl Grey -- just what one would expect from an Earl Grey tea!	1
The tea is very good and came exactly as advertised.  The container was full to the top with tea leaves.  Great for someone who enjoys a delicious cup of tea to get a kick start in the morning.	1
Tea Time is now all the time	1
This was a gift for my cousin. He freaked out when he opened it. This is his very favorite! He drinks about 4 cups a day.	1
I do think of myself as kind of a tea snob. My favorite kinds of tea change quite often, but earl grey remains a faithful favorite. This earl grey supreme has been my favorite earl grey blend since I first tried it. Not too creamy tasting like other mixes, this blend is smooth but still bold tasting. Great with a little milk and sugar. Also great for those trying to make tea lattes.	1
Good and strong taste. Not flowery like some others.	1
Excellent flavor! Fast shipping. Thank you.	1
This tea is wonderful.  It is Earl Grey with a little extra bergamot.  I put it in my IngenuiTEA infuser.  Awesome cuppa every time!	1
This is my favorite earl gray. Perfect balance of black tea and bergamot. The tin can also be pretty useful when you've finished it.	1
Supreme. Pricey, but truly the best Earl Grey. Hands down.	1
My favorite freaking tea in the whole world! I thought twinings of london was my favorite earl grey. You have to try this, you will absolutely love this!	1
The flavor and smell are rich and delicious. My husband, who hates tea, loves this one! Every night he asks me to prepare some Earl Grey for him, ever since I bought this one.	1
Right off the bat it smells great- a lot of 'bad' earl grey's smell way too much like bergamot; here you can smell a hint of it as well as the silver tip.  The silver tip really comes off when the tea is hot and the taste is just wonderful.  Recommend fully and I will def be a repeat customer!	1
This tea has a great taste. It is not overwhelming and not artificial. Harley and Sons is a very good tea brand. Highly recommended.	1
Even the Earl of Grey himself would be proud of this blend. I highly recommend with a little milk and a sweetener of your choice.	1
Excellent balance of bergamot flavour and  black tea.  Exactly what I wanted.  It's hard to find loose tea anymore, and I prefer it above bagged tea for several reasons.	1
I'm no tea connoisseur, but out of the 5 or 6 Earl Grey teas I've tried, this is DEFINITIVELY the best!	1
I bought this for my husband because he loves tea & especially Earl Grey. I read the reviews & went for it. He absolutely loves this & we will be buying more very soon!!!!	1
Just upsetting they placed a inventory sticker directly over the 'how to use' instructions on the back. Other than that the tea was fresh and yummy.	1
I purchased this as a ate Christmas gift for a friend. They LOVED it. They say the tea is very high quality and has an excellent scent and flavor. I am very pleased with how well this went over as a gift.	1
Good strong flavor. Great tea but would like more than 4oz per 10 bucks. But maybe I will find that is the best deal I will get. Cannot find a lot of good loose tea and this has a real nice Earl Grey flavor. If you like Tazo or Bigelow you will dig this.	1
This tea is amazing! I am a huge coffee nerd, and this has just about converted me completely to a tea drinker.	1
Tasted great. The bergamot flavor is at a reasonable level, complimenting the tea well without drowning it out like a lot of other cheaper teas.	1
Excellent Earl Grey. I blend 80% Lipton's loose leaf with 20% Harney's Earl Gray. Very nice. A solid hint of the Earl, but not overpowering.	1
This is one of the best Earl Grey teas I've ever brewed.  It has a smooth caramel taste that appears just after you breath its delightful scent.	1
Earl Grey is a dime a dozen, but let me tell you, Harney & Sons makes a fantastic Earl Grey.  If I were in charge of programming the replicator recipes in the 24th century, this is the Earl Grey that Captain Picard would be drinking.	1
I really like this tea. The silvertip add something, and the bergamot comes through wonderfully.I would definitely buy again.	1
I try to eat miso somewhat consistently, but it was missing something, and making the stock with this put it spot on! Like most Americans I was a tad hesitant with the overwhelming fishy smell that it has, but it is sooooo worth it. Once the miso paste, green onions and veggies were in... soup was perfect!	1
Even if I'm not making miso or another soup, I add a little of this to my water when boiling noodles. Gives a very good flavor to any dish! :)	1
Nice rich quality to the flavor, very classic taste. Just be sure not to boil hard after adding the stock.	1
Excellent taste in miso soup.	1
I'm surprised with this product.  it helps enhance foods with a delicious umami flavor and actually makes a nice broth for ramen. i use it in a mason jar with veggies and noodles for work and when its time to eat i simply add boiling water!! its been a real time saver!	1
Been using this for years to make fish cake soup. Love it.	1
Easy to use. Tastes great!	1
Awesome product! Perfect for miso soup	1
Ever find soy sauce even the low sodium soy sauce to be overpowering. Well this is your solution. It has a great soy sauce taste and is sweet not salty. It is great for dipping tempura and sushi. I like to baste my sea scallops with a little bit of this tempura sauce and some oyster sauce, a killer combo. I use it for cooking and dipping. It's tough to get at any of my shopping centers so I was very glad to find it at Amazon delivered right to my feet. thank you.	1
This adds so much flavor to soups and does not taste fishy.	1
excellent flavor	1
I was a little skeptical when I ordered it, but it really does taste good and now I can make miso soup at home.	1
Perfect for making miso soup. Tastes great!	1
If you follow the mixing instructions with the correct ratio of water to dipping sauce, it tastes just like the restaurants dipping sauce.	1
Good product....love it...	1
If you cook Japanese food.  This is a must have additives.  I would buy this again next time!  Great for miso soup, Japanese styled fried rice, Cha-Sui, and etc.  Just use it in small amount, do not over use it!	1
Perfect for my Miso soups and other Japanese recipes. Highly recommended by my Japanese Sister in law and my neighbor. Dissolves quickly.	1
I use this (along with MSG) to make Kewpie mayonnaise. If you've ever tried Kewpie you will never go back to anything else.We take it up a notch by making it at home with a stick blender. Quick, simple & easy plus no chemicals	1
good flavor but I have to use a lot of it.	1
I used this to make Inarizushi and it was marvelous! So tasty	1
Delicious for fried rice	1
Arrived on time as described and tastes great. Good price too.	1
This was a great addition to my cupboard and adobo recipe.  I'm not a fan of vinegar, so I used half as much as my recipe called for.  Datu Puti is very good in my chicken adobo recipe.	1
Side-by-side, this and distilled white vinegar (DWV) smell very similar. The difference? This is made from Sugar Cane and DWV is made from corn (most of the time). That matters because, being allergic to corn, vinegar makes me sick. THIS does not! Made an AWESOME hot wings sauce with this and cayenne peppers and it came out amazing! I am DEFINITELY buying this again!	1
You want to make pork adobo?  This is what you need.	1
5  Stars great product.	1
Vendor shipped it faster than I expected As for the product itself, the sweet sap is taken from sugar cane and is used to make this vinegar. The vinegar has a bit of a tart effect to it, and is often used as a dipping sauce for various foods. It is common in Filipino cuisine to add peppers or spices to make it a spicy and tangy sauce, and is great for your deep fried shrimp and pork!	1
been trying to find this for the longest time. it takes me back to my childhood. Not a strong smelling or tasting vinegar. So if you are expecting it to be like an apple cider type vinegar forget it this is not what you are looking for. This is a sweeter more mild less acidic vinegar from the Philippines. I use it in marinades and it adds fantastic flavors without being overpowering	1
Delicious.  Has a great punch of vinegar	1
Yummy yummy miso soup.	1
Perfect for my Japanese omelette dish.	1
This makes great miso soup	1
This is my go to dashi. Good stuff. Good price.	1
Great product. I'm getting into Japanese cooking.	1
great taste give my miso soup exactly the flavor it needs	1
Adds the perfect flavor for miso in combination with miso paste.	1
great product - thanks	1
I bought this to use for a pork katsudon recipe, and my does it work wonders.  I can really taste the difference now that i'm using authentic ingredients, you can't get the flavor otherwise.	1
Great product was testing it out with Red Miso paste works well together.	1
Dashi is almost literally a necessity when it comes to cooking traditional Japanese food, especially when you don't have the time or resources to make stock from scratch. Just a little of it goes a long ways, so you get plenty of bang for your buck, not to mention if you add a little soy sauce and sake, it makes the flavor profile of any meat so much deeper. I seriously can't recommend this enough.	1
I'm new to the miso soup scene and was making possibly the biggest rookie mistake ever. I would just whisk a big spoonful of miso into hot water and call it a day. You can image why I thought I just didn't like miso. This changed my whole viewpoint, of course. A spoon of this, bring it to a good heat (but not boil), turn off the gas, add your miso, add your toppings, done. Delicious. Truly makes a world of difference.	1
Tastes like my childhood. My mother would use this in her cooking and I've since started using it mostly for miso soup.	1
This is a great broth for miso	1
Made a couple of Japanese dishes with it and liked the flavor. Actually, it would probably be good added to any soup or noodle dish.	1
Just what I needed! I missed good ramen so much, I'm glad I can at least make dashi with this.	1
good to use  for soups	1
Another item i re-up on when running low. It makes a great soup base with even just water.	1
Great for miso and authentic	1
I moved and have yet to find a grocery store near my new abode that carries world items like this in their stocks, so I turned to amazon for it.This is exactly what I needed, thank you!So far as the actual product goes, it's just instant bonito stock. Sorta like bouillon cubes - it's not the absolute best way to go about it but especially in this case, it's very much close enough, especially for the effort involved.If you're looking to make a miso base for any dish, this will do the trick.	1
Miso soup is now a standard in my house.  This little jar will probably last my for a year, at least, so I consider it to be a good buy.	1
I was using plain white vinegar for my adobo but finally bought this.  The flavor is incredible and a huge difference in Filipino food.	1
I use this because it has a strong vinegar taste	1
Exactly what I need to help make a sauce for wings	1
Tastes like vinegar	1
Great for marinating meat. Good vinegar taste!	1
Legit filipino vinegar for adobo.	1
Great product for Asian dishes!!	1
Great price, fast service.	1
If you are cooking Philippine Adobo this  is the vinegar for you. It produces a nice, acidic back taste along with its sister soy sauce.	1
Great stuff! Gives dishes that undeniably Japanese flavor.	1
This is the ingredient to use to make Miso Soup taste as it should be.	1
I just received this order this morning. There were no packaging issues. I have used this item before in my meal preparations, but purchased at a Japanese grocery store. Quality is unsurpassed.	1
Great addition to our miso soup!	1
. A tiny bit goes a long way and the flavor is great.	1
I absolutely love this product and keep it on hand all the time.  Highly recommend!  So tasty and easy to grab when I need a hot cup of soup!	1
This is so simple to use and has made making miso soup so easy!  It tastes great, not too fishy, in my opinion, but everyone's tastes are different, just use less or more to taste.	1
Making Ikura never been more interesting.	1
Great product. Easy to make!	1
A little goes a long way but great flavor base to many Japanese dishes.	1
A must for home prep of Japanese soups.  Nice value.	1
This is instant fish broth.  It has earned a permanent place in my kitchen.	1
A must have for Japanese cuisine	1
Do you want good Miso soup? This is how you cook good Miso soup.	1
I love this stuff. It is easy to make and has great flavor. I use dashi on a fairly regular basis and I have neither the time nor the inclination to make it from scratch, so this is perfect.	1
excellent and easy	1
Exactly what I was needing to make homemade miso soup.  After I bought this the first time, I ordered a few more before I was even half way through with this stock. I am so excited to make my own miso soup now!	1
Very good!  Not too salty.  Nice bonito flavor, but not too fishy.  Savory and delicious!	1
I bought the Dashi to make Miso soup- turned out fantastic! This really is the secret ingredient to amazing miso soup.	1
Could not find this in my market. Since I ordered this it is now stocked. Really tasty sauce fr BBQ ribs	1
Really great product. A must for any panko dish. Our local store stopped selling it so I was happy to find it online!	1
great  to perk up  sauces	1
Great for desserts	1
I bought this for a special recipe that required the Chinese Five Spices in Pumpkin Pie.  I was surprised at how much difference the addition of Annise spice made in the taste.  I like it!	1
Only 5 spices with licorice root in it.  Best on the market.	1
I love this spice.  My mom used this when I was a little girl with all her Chinese cooking. Perfect for egg rolls. You only need a small pinch for a ton of flavor.  shipping was fast and well packaged	1
I add a little of this to my miso soup for a deeper flavor. Great quality product.	1
The real deal at a fair price!	1
Delicious, easy to use, fabulous. If you're not worried about the sodium this product is delicious and authentic. I used it in a homemade miso soup.	1
Good product but very  strong.  I used half the called for amount.	1
This made a simple and great tasting Miso Soup.  I would recommend it without hesitation.	1
YUM! This is the perfect addition to miso soup. Highly recommended!	1
I have not tried a different brand but I would order this again. It is absolutely necessary to make Miso soup.	1
Delicious! I will definitely buy again. I'm no expert on soups, but this worked great for my first try at Miso.	1
It's very strong in this form and the first time I made miso (which includes Dashi) the receipt said 2 tablespoons and it tasted like fish soup.  ugh.  Anyway, it's strong so start small and taste test through the whole thing.	1
Tasty, good quality fish stock granules.  Makes excellent miso soup, just like our beloved sushi restaurant!	1
A nice, small portion of a product that I regularly use in my cooking!	1
I like it. Good for miso, for tamagoyaki and I also add it to some food instead of salt - for example, to frozen vegetables with a 2 tbs of water before microwaving them. works well!	1
I used up the last of my 5 spice powder -- also by Dynasty.  I looked for another one, of any brand, for a month or so.  None of the grocery stores locally or within about 30 miles had any.  I am very happy with the one I bought from Amazon.	1
We love to wok and cook asian but have not had a chance to really cook with this, but I opened it and used it on a diet asian frozen dinner the other day and it rocks!  I can smell every spice!  Can not WAIT to wok with this!  Nice glass jar, packaged great, tight and safety lid... YUM WHAT a great addition to our every day or asian spice mixes!  I think just sprinkled on white rice would be fabulous.  A Must for your spice cabinet!	1
I keep a jar of Chinese Five Spices on hand for a flavorful change up from the typical American home-cooked Chinese dish.  Because we enjoy a meal that doesn't have the same flavor bite after bite, I typically will cook either the meat or the side dish with the Five Spices . Dynasty's Chinese Five Spices consist of Cinnamon, Star Anise, Fennel, Cloves, Ginger, Licorice, Szechuan Pepper, and White Pepper which produces a warm sweet flavor.	1
I use this in my dry rub for ribs and everyone loves it.  Give it a try.	1
Arrived on tim . Item was as described	1
bought for my mom and she's still raving about it	1
Good for making fish broth which is important soup base for Japanese food.	1
easy to make loved the flavor.	1
Great to have in the house to make recipes.	1
Authentic fish soup stock with great taste. Easy to use and dissolves nicely.	1
This is the key to making miso soup.	1
I use this as a base for miso soup.  This is very flavorful.  I may have to buy more since my son has been requesting miso soup on a weekly basis.	1
Great price and connivence. Works like a charm in my required recipes.	1
This is an excellent seasoning ingredient,It isn't overly spicy and it's  flair would taste great on beef or chicken; in oriental or traditional american dishes.	1
It is what it says it is.	1
Wonderful flavor enhancer for veggies.	1
Ingredients list : Cinnamon, Star Anise, Fennel, Ginger, Cloves, White Pepper And Licorice Root.let's see, that's 7 spices in this jar of 5 spice.  Wonder if the other two just jumped in without asking?  Totally explains the fall of the Chinese dynasties.	1
Great taste and  cost and size	1
Do I need to write anymore?	1
It smells s good.	1
Nice flavoring for dishes. Give it a try, not just for Oriental food.	1
Haven't tried just but sure it will make good miso soup.	1
Great product	1
Small container, but goes ALONG way. You really don't need much in cooking. Has a strong fishy smell, but once you put it into whatever you're making, the smell goes away.	1
when you don't have the time to prepare kombu and bonito flakes, like for a quick bowl of miso breakfast soup, Hon-Dashi really takes just a few minutes to fix. throw in some of last nights noodles, a raw egg, and you are ready for work. It's not quite as good as the real thing, but it sure helps for the quick fix.	1
Perfect for miso soup. The pre-packaged miso soup is way to salty for me. I can make a moderately seasoned soup using miso paste,  kombu and wakame, seasoned with the Hon-Dashi.	1
Great Product  Fast Shipping A+++	1
Remembering what we ate as kids, and this dashi is exactly what we had for our miso soup and noodles and broth, YUM!	1
I love the flavor and use it not only when I make Chinese food, but in other items.	1
Ah, that hits the spot. Needed this for my Chinese dishes, and I don't regret it. It's the same as the stuff I'd buy in China.	1
We find it to be indispensable for asian cooking. It adds a special flavor to chop suey and chow mein dishes.	1
This is an excellent version of five-spice powder, which does not seem to follow any standard formula.  I have several different ones on hand, and this is my favorite.  Good flavor.	1
Excellent price and the price is very reasonable. Have used this in several Asian recipes and going to try in more savory dishes.	1
I had never tried any of the oriental seasonings before and I'm so glad I did.  I always wondered why I couldn't get the flavors right when I cooked dishes at home.  Now, I know!	1
Haven't tried this yet, but it sure smells good.  Can't wait to try it soon.  Should add a new dimension to my food.	1
Whether rice, noodles, stir-fry... these LKL condiments really bring the taste to the table! If you want authentic Asian taste, this will not disappoint!	1
I'm not a great cook, but you can use this stuff for almost anything.  It tastes great, and a little goes a long way.  It's pretty salty, but I personally love it.  Goes GREAT with rice and about a million other things.	1
adds some flavor and garlic on almost anything	1
I used to find Five Spice in the supermarket when we lived in PHX. But here in NC it is hard to find so I happy that I can order this online.	1
I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful. It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well. I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard.	1
great spice that I've added to my portfolio of spices. Great for ribs and other Asian cooking. generous amount for a small price	1
The product was such a great price, and it made my food taste so good.  I had a hard time finding this product elsewhere.	1
I needed 5 spice powder. So I tried Dynasty. Excellent product. Wonderful flavor. If you never tried Chinese cooking, you are really missing out! Please try it!	1
If you're looking for an unexpected way to spice up lots of dishes, this is a great start.  Makes Asian inspired dishes a breeze and adds flair to all kinds of dishes from salads to pastries.	1
I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it!	1
Great find as I didn't have to run all over town to look for this.  It came very quickly.  Thank you Amazon.com.	1
This product was and is wonderful, I love the finger-licking flavor that it adds to my cooking. I 100% reccommend this to anyone who calls themselves a cook. Thank You.Satisfied Customer,Mrs. Pauline Hardin	1
It is the best tasting soy sauce available. It is Naturaly Brewed so no sodium benz. Just water, soy and alcohol.I've tried many Soy sauces and Tamari, the only thing comparable is Wegman brand and this is better . If you can find this at your local store it will be a little cheaper, but not many places carry this.	1
Love this soy sauce. Not salty...umami at its best!	1
They serve this at a local  Thai place we like.  It is so much better than any other soy sauce available-- PERIOD!	1
I have always liked Kikkoman.  But I tried this and love it too.  If you have an oriental food store in your area I suggest trying the made in Japan versions of both Kikkoman and Yamasa.  They come in liter size bottles and contain alcohol instead of sodium benzoate as preservative and slightly better flavor IMHO.	1
If you go to a good Japanese restaurant, chances are they have Yamasa on the table. You can't do any better than that.	1
This product reminds me of a thousand lunches of chicken teriyaki and mounds of steamed rice. Why eat out, when you can drizzle some soy over your food at home. Make everyday a teriyaki day!	1
Delicious, came wrapped in bubble wrap AND shrink wrapped.Excellent with many dishes, personally I use it as a base for dishes, but it is fine just mixed in with food by itself.	1
I use these sauce for my fish and beef Sichuan dishes.  It is really great with fish, as from start to finish it takes me less than 10 min to have a dish that everyone rave about.  By the way, one spoon is more than enough, and always fry it just after the garlic but before adding the beef or the fish to make sure that it will get in your meat or fish.	1
This is now my new favorite go to for marinating chicken, meat, ribs and so on.  We love heat in this family and this product certainly fits the bill.  Will definitely be ordering again.	1
I love this chili sauce and i was so happy to see that it 's available online.you' ll love it too!	1
THIS WHAT NOT THE ITEMS I USED TO BUY IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY, BUT I USE IT IN SOUPS, IN STIR FRIES, DIPS ETC. ITS TAKES GREAT ITS NOT AS SPICY AS I LIKE, BUT I LIKE REALLY HOT SPICES. THIS IS MILDER AND IG YOU ENJOY CHILE AND GARLIC YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT.	1
I love this stuff.  When I'm pressed for time or don't have the requisite jalepenos or serranos on hand, out it comes.  Spicy with just the right amount of garlic it works great for any cuisine that demands hot and spicy--Thai, Mexican, Chinese, yada yada.  You can't imagine the sublime note it adds to mango salsa--fabulous.  Available, by the way, on most west coast grocer's shelves.  If not, buy it from Amazon.  Indespensible.	1
I couldn't love this product more! My family uses it in so many dishes. It takes dishes that are already good to another level.	1
This is the real thing. Good for all Asian cuisines, especially Vietnamese and Thai dishes. And the bottle size makes it a bargain.	1
I'm a cook who has worked for a james beard award winning chef. this fish sauce is literally the only fish sauce I will use. beats red boat, and everything else is just a laugh in your rear view mirror as you peel out doing donuts from fishsauceville. leave the suckers in the dust, buy flying lion brand fish sauce.PS - buy this locally, the price on here is absurd.	1
Flying Lion fish sauce has a more subtle and complex flavor than Squid and other more common brands. Sure it costs more but how many bottles do most people buy each month? This is affordable luxury that will make a noticeable improvement in your cooking.	1
I was concerned that this would be the more common sweet version, but it isn't. It has only a slight hint of sweetness, but overall it is tangy savory rich and versatile.	1
I've used this product in two different recipes and the flavor is right on. I would buy this product again.	1
This is something that I haven't worked with yet but if it is as good as everything else I am sure that I will be totally happy with	1
some recipes say you can substitute balsamic for black vinegar, but balsamic never tastes right. this makes recipes taste right	1
So here are the 2 things that I loved about it -1. Packaging - Excellent - This one came packaged to perfection!2. Flavor profile - Crisp, definitely what I was hoping for.This is the first time I have used black vinegar and this one definitely did wonders. It adds on a fine smoky vinegary goodness to the food. I used it mostly for cooking chicken and pork..	1
milder than most vinegars, but with its own very special taste to add to Ume Plum vinegar, and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor!	1
Just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes.  Glad to have this in my pantry.  Flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes.  Product delivery was great - just as expected.	1
I could not find this in the grocery store in town, so I had to buy it online for a recipe.  It worked out great.	1
Good stuff.  Better pricing at local Asian market ?	1
Black vinegar has become my favorite condiment. I love it cooking and in homemade salad dressings. It is pretty versatile.	1
Ah yes, those special oriental ingredients.  In some parts of the country, they just are not stocked.  Thus subtle flavor of black vinegar enhances many dishes, including hot and sour soup and others.	1
We have been waiting for this item. To purchase it at a price, we thought was reasonable. This is why we jumped on it.Thank you for that choice.November	1
Chinese black vinegar is an essential cooking item.  It is akin to Itsluan balsamic vinegar; it is not sour.  This is an authentic brand and has placed first in many tastings.  It is my favorite but each person must decide for themself what suits their palate best.	1
I like black vinegar, I like the way it taste. and this is good,  michael	1
A big bottle of yum	1
i use this in my cooking...excellent.	1
Cannot find locally.  Needed staple for Asain cooking	1
Item as described	1
What we expected.  really adds favor to the food.  Love it.	1
used in many dishes	1
Mild and delicious, I like this just about as well as white rice vinegar. It's a good choice when you need a gentle souring agent.	1
exactly what I was looking for and couldn't find in our asian grocery stores!	1
This is a great Chinese black vinegar. You can get this black vinegar  at any Asian market for half of the price. I used this for dipping Thai and Chinese sauces, and I don't think you can substitute this vinegar.	1
Good Product.  Very hard to find in grocery stores.	1
Delicious.  A must have for hot and sour soup.	1
A different taste from what I'm familiar with. Enhances a lot of different foods. Makes vegetables stand out and gives new life to bland dishes.	1
I purchased this for a Tai recipe and it made a big improvement in the taste.  No other Vinegar worked.	1
Many of the recipes I use for Chinese food advise Worcestershire sauce as an alternative to black vinegar, but I like to keep it as authentic as I can and let's face it, Worcestershire sauce and black vinegar do not taste the same. I can't find black vinegar at any of my local grocery stores. Once again. Amazon came through for me. This is the same Chinese black vinegar that I bought at Asian markets back when I still lived in the Big City.	1
This vinegar has been a great addition to my asian spice collection. It is perfect for making hot and sour soup that will have the dark color you are looking for. Enjoy!	1
If you're into asian cuisine, you'll surely enjoy this sauce. It has the right amount of spiciness and saltiness in it. I can totally eat plain white rice with this chili oil.It has 2 parts: the oil and the stuff in it. Make sure you get a good ratio of both, because if you have too much of one component, it's not as fun to eat.	1
I got this specifically to make dan dan noodles, and it was perfect! the chunky bits of chili are so good I use this when I make chinese stir frys too. its really spicy but not omg my mouth..its a smoother spicy if that makes any sense lol	1
Tea drinkers! This is the best green tea you are likely to come across. Give it a try.	1
Nicest Jasmine Tea I have had. The Jasmine flavour is very much stronger than other brands, which for me is the attraction. It is stronger than the tea flavour.	1
This is the best Jasmine tea I have ever tried. I have tried many different brands, but this one is, by far, the best!	1
I drink lots of iced tea.  This is the best jasmine green tea!  It's not soapy, I think that is just the jasmine flavor that some people will dislike.  I personally find it extremely refreshing.	1
This tea was served at the Royal Thai in Newport Beach.  I had to have some more.. Delicious tea. It is green tea and jasmine combo.	1
I bought this by chance and use it to make iced tea.  I find it has the most refreshing flavor.  I have tried many brands of tea but none have the essence of the flower of jasmine that I find as pleasing as this brand.  I highly recommend.	1
I discovered this at a nearby restaurant and had to track it down. It has a light and flowery flavor. Not overpowering, and not too light. It's just right!	1
I tried this tea in a Thai restaurant that we frequent.  It is so delicious!  As someone else said, it is very aromatic without being overpowering.  If the tea is not steeped too long, it will not be bitter, as with any other tea.  I actually saved the tab on the tea bag in the pot and went on a search on the internet for this tea--which I have never done.  Enjoy!	1
This tea was recommended to us so decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did! It has a very delicate taste and is lightly floral without being overwhelming. Perfect with a little bit of Splenda. It shipped fast and the price was right!	1
I love this chili oil but I was so disappointed to find it at Walmart for 3.98!! Will buy this on Walmart	1
If only I could give this a ten star it's totally delicious & adds a touch of spice I better order this on a monthly basis	1
Tasted great and reminds me of eating spicy Chinese food in restaurants whenever I use it.	1
Never bought this before but it tasted just as how I imagined it. No crunch to it, just heat and some flavor that comes with it. Love it!	1
This stuff is really hard to find, but must to compliment any type of Chinese cuisine.	1
my all time favorite chili oil/sauce. perfect for any food!!	1
Love this product. I shared it with a friend, will order again, Great taste for soups, seafood, chicken! Thank you for creating such a wonderful tasting product. Spicy and good!	1
Real talk, this is amazing, smelling it reveals an almost garlic sesame oil that is amazing. The taste it adds is so god damn good!	1
The best authentic hot chili oil. It makes everything taste better. It adds the perfect Unami !I order 3 jars at a time.	1
Love it!!! We put it on everything. What a flavor!!!	1
Great product as always.	1
Love, love, love this stuff. The perfect touch to an avocado toast breakfast and so many other dishes.	1
Great addition to many Asian foods.  Quite spicy.	1
Pairs really well with Chinkiang vinegar and ginger to make a simple sauce. Not incredibly spicy, so if you're looking for anything more than understated heat, you might need to look elsewhere.	1
Best chili oil ever! I like it so much that I started trying to find recipes to use with it. By the way, the Walmart near me has this stuff, same size, for $2 and some change. I couldn't believe it when I saw the price! So check first to see if one near you has it.	1
Made my siomai perfect. Just what I have been looking for.	1
Finished it in two weeks. If you cook with it be mindful that there is salt in it already.	1
Love this stuff! If I ran out I would buy 2 more jars. I used it in my Pho soup.	1
This is a staple in our house. We've tried different kinds of chili oil and this just hit the spot: hot but not numbingly hot and it is garlicky With a hint of sweetness. This holiday season, I had to go to 5 different Asian stores in my city of Indianapolis and found out that everyone was out of it! Thank heavens for amazon!	1
Great taste for those who like the spice in Chinese recipes.  I was unable to find this product in my local grocery stores.	1
5 stars! I love this Chili Oil. It's best for everything add little kick to every foods. I specially like to put it to pork dumplings with soy sauce and lime.  Perfect. 	1
The absolute very best Umami chili sauce there is. If you've always wanted to have the Chinese delivery place chili hot oil at home so you could use it on other foods, or wherever, look no further - this is the one. The best one. Ever.I have bought this sauce 7 times over now. I have tried other brands and types - this is it. Cannot be beat. Give it a try. You will LOVE it.	1
Closest thing I've found to what I used to use at a noodle bar in Hong Kong - nothing else seems to come close - perfect addition to almost anything - I often use it as an addition to ramen or lentil stew - I always have a bottle or two extra in the house so that I never run out. :-)	1
Addictive. Best quality I can find anywhere. Don't stop making it!!	1
This is the old stuff, which (at least in California) is extremely hard to find: dried chili in vegetable oil.  I recall that you used to find a jar of this hot classic on every table of every Chinese-American restaurant, but for some unknown reason they seem to have switched to chili pastes (too sharp, vinegary, fruity for my liking).  Very glad I can get the old burn back -- I might just start carrying this jar whenever I go out for Asian cuisine, since it's too good to just use on leftovers.	1
exactly what it's supposed to be. Spices up pretty much anything.	1
I use this to make a spicy cucumber salad and it is full of flavor and I love using it!	1
I love this brand of wakame and use it in making miso!	1
Excellent, I make a salad out of with just Sesame oil and Tsuyu noodle sauce base. Tastes great.	1
I use this with the dried anchovies for miso soup.	1
I love my EXTRA hot mustard when I go to a chineese restaurant, but it is not available in my area. I  even tried to get it through my local grocery (Publix),but it is not in their catalog. This was recomended by a friend AND it was great! It is good on fried won-ton noodles, egg rolls, ... I will order more in the future, in greater quantity.	1
I eat Dim Sum at a local Chinese restaurant.  The population in my area is 60% Chinese.  The restaurant (Full House--excellent) serves Dim Sum every day with a small dish of chili sauce and mustard.  Dynasty mustard tastes just like the restaurant's mustard.  The restaurant is authentic Chinese--most of the workers do not speak English. I recommend this mustard.	1
PRETTY HOT BUT GOOD, DON'T NEED AS MUCH AS THE REGULAR,THEREFORE CHEAPER PER USE WOULD BUY MORE IF I EVER RUN OUT	1
I love egg rolls when I order Chinese, but none of the delivery places seem to offer any hot mustard anymore.No worries, this Dynasty Chinese-style Mustard hits the spot!It's got the perfect amount of kick.	1
It was what I expected.  I love it....extra hot, great on sausage and stir fired chicken...or on anything you use musstard on	1
This improves any food item. It is my ideal condiment.	1
Nice flavor and elegant heat. Local favorite restaurant just does not get the spicy level up where I like it and this brings the heat. I'll be ordering another in about 2 weeks!	1
Spicy, smoky, with a bite.  Not your usual Asian hot sauce.  Made with fermented beans, is a special treat from Hong Kong.	1
Some seriously hot oil. Excellent flavor. Highly recommend!	1
I think this is a bit hotter than the S&B Chili Oil with Crunchy Garlic and the nearly identical Momoya product.  This one seems heavier on the heat than the salt, while the others are heavier on the salt than the heat.  They're all good, just different heat/salt ratios.  One advantage to this brand is that the container is much larger than the S&B and Momoya jars I've seen, so it lasts longer.  As with the others, give this a good stir before you use it.	1
This stuff is great! Really spicy (which is what I wanted) and it's delish in a stir fry. I used it on chicken drumsticks and they came out delicious as well.	1
I love this stuff. Great flavor. Can really spice up your food.  I have to tone the heat down when cooing for the rest of my family, then add the chili oil for me!!!!	1
We have a favorite recipe that calls for chili oil. I couldn't find it in our local grocery and so was glad to find it on Amazon. It is the only chili oil I have tried. I found it to be very authentic tasting. Unless I venture to try another one and find it to be better, I am comfortable leaving a 5 star review.	1
I am a fan of spicy hot Asian food and this is the best bottled chili oil I have tried ... so good I will no longer bother trying to duplicate my favorite Asian restaurant chili oil myself	1
