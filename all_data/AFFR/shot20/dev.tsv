Once in awhile I will locate it at Big Lots or somewhere like that, but that's rare, which is weird since I live in a bigger city so you'd think I'd be able to find it. Nope. Lucky for me it was listed on Amazon for a really good price. I admit that I do prefer their organic oolong, but this one is really good as well.	1
