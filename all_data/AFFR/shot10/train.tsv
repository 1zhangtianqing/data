I love this brand and all the flavors available.  For me it is not just Better but perfect.  I never waste a can of broth anymore-- make exactly what I need.  For me, it tastes much better, and depending upon what I am making, I can make it as strong or as weak as I want. I introduced my adult children to it -- they love it too. Mushroom gravy on that steak anyone?  Yum Yum.	1

Our family loves to use this cheese to make cheese-flavored popcorn. We do a light coat of the popcorn with butter (so the powder sticks) then toss it around in a couple of tablespoons of this stuff, and it's awesome. Flavor is just perfect. We also sometimes use it to turn cream sauces into cheese sauces.	1
Last month my husband and I went there during Restaurant week and we ordered the calamari as our appetizer. We both were sick the next day, with all of the above symptoms. (didnt associate it to being the calamari because we ea there often). We had family members in town this past weekend and we took them there. Again, ordered the calamari and everyone is sick with the same symptoms after eating the calamari. My husband called the restaurant this morning and was asked did we order the calamari!!!!!!!!!!!!! Was told we were the 3rd complaint regarding getting sick after eating the calamari . They took down our number to call us back????????	0

What can I say? I'm a cheap date...I love this stuff...well-chilled and slathered on hardboiled eggs in particular...I even add it to freshly made thin-crust pizza...it's relatively inexpensive and while this black version (like the red) obviously has some added dyes, the pop is nice, the flavor salty and I'll order again as long as the price remains the same...a fun treat to have on hand when I'm craving the pop and flavor of lumpfish caviar :-))	1

I am excited to begin using this product to create my creamy cheese sauce and to add to my macaroni and cheddar bake.  It is a lot more convenient than shredding and melting cheeses or cooking into a sauce.  Also, I think it would be a very good addition to some potato dishes to give them some pizzaz!	1
